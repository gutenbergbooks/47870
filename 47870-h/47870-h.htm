<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>Five years have now elapsed since the publication
of my volume, "Chats on English China," and in the
interval a great number of readers have written to
me suggesting that I should write a companion
volume dealing with old English earthenware. It
is my hope that this complementary volume will
prove of equal value to that large class of collectors
who desire to know more about their hobby but are
fearful to pursue the subject further without special
guidance.</p>

<p>It is a matter for congratulation in these days,
when so many books have only a short life for one
season, to know that, owing to the enterprise of my
publisher in making the "Chats" Series for collectors
so widely known, the volume dealing with old
English China still retains its vitality, and holds its
place as a popular guide to collecting with profit.</p>

<p>As far as is possible in the limits of this volume,
the subject of old English earthenware has been
dealt with in order to show how peculiarly national
the productions of the potter have been. The collection
of old English earthenware, in the main, is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
within the reach of those who have slender purses.
English china during the last decade has reached
prohibitive prices, and there is every likelihood that
old English earthenware will in the near future
become of unprecedented value.</p>

<p>I have carefully refrained from confining my
treatment of the subject to rare museum examples
which are unlikely to come under the hand of the
average collector. It is necessary to have the ideal
in view, but it must be borne in mind that such
specimens must always be ideal to the larger number
of collectors. I have, therefore, without belittling
the old potters' art, given considerable attention to
the golden mean in the realm of old earthenware
to be collected.</p>

<p>The two volumes&mdash;"Chats on English China,"
which mainly consists of an outline history of
English china, with hints as to its collection, and
the present volume, "Chats on English Earthenware,"
with a faithful <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the work of the
old English potters&mdash;together form a record of
what has been done by the potter in England, and
are intended to be practical working handbooks for
the collector of old English china and English
earthenware.</p>

<p>The illustrations in this volume have been carefully
chosen to illustrate the letterpress, and to
enable readers to identify specimens that may come
under their observation.</p>

<p><i>Lists of Prices</i> accompany the various sections
whenever it has been thought that they may be
of practical value. I am indebted for the accuracy
of these prices to that useful and authoritative
quarterly publication, "Auction Sale Prices," which
is a supplement to the <i>Connoisseur</i>, and forms the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
standard record in the collectors' world of the prices
realised at auction.</p>

<p>A <i>Bibliography</i> of works on the subject has been
given, in order that those who may wish to delve
deeper may consult special volumes dealing in detail
with special sub-heads of old earthenware.</p>

<p>I must here record my thanks for the generous aid
I have received from possessors of fine examples who
have willingly placed their treasures at my disposal,
and by so doing have enabled me to present them
as illustrations in this volume. To Colonel and
Mrs. Dickson I am especially indebted for many
specimens from their interesting collection. Miss
Feilden has been good enough to select some
typical examples from her fine collection of old
earthenware of exceptional interest, and they are
here reproduced by her courtesy, and to Mr.
Richard Wilson I owe my gratitude for kindly
allowing illustrations of some examples of Leeds
cream-ware from his remarkable collection. Mr.
Robert Bruce Wallis, with fine enthusiasm, has
spared no trouble to enable me to present some of
his rare examples, and Mrs. Herman Liebstein
has kindly supplied some fine pieces from her
collection. Mr. W. G. Honey has also kindly
contributed several excellent illustrations of specimens
in his collection.</p>

<p>The illustrations of specimens in the Victoria and
Albert Museum are reproduced by permission of
the Board of Education, and similar permission has
been accorded me by the authorities of the British
Museum to illustrate some of the rare examples in
that collection. By a like courtesy I am enabled
to give an illustration of an exceptional piece of
marked Wincanton Delft, and some other examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
from the collection at the Royal Scottish Museum,
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood and Sons, of Etruria
have afforded me the pleasure of illustrating some
fine specimens in their museum, including examples
of the celebrated service made for the Empress
Catherine II. of Russia. I am especially indebted
to their courtesy in giving me facilities for the
reproduction of a fine series of photographs showing
the various stages in the manufacture of
earthenware, which illustrations should be of practical
advantage to the student and of no little
interest to the general collector. It should be
mentioned that these illustrations have been specially
selected to represent the stages through which a
piece of old earthenware passed in the hands of
the Staffordshire potters.</p>

<p>In regard to the illustrations of the rare examples
of Leeds and other pieces decorated at Lowestoft, and
for the latest details known of this class of ware, I
have to acknowledge the particular kindness of Mr.
Merrington Smith, fine art expert of Lowestoft, who
is known in connection with the excavations conducted
a few years ago on the site of the old
Lowestoft china factory, and whose detailed research
regarding that factory has dissipated many erroneous
theories and thrown so much light on its history
and achievements.</p>

<p>To Mr. Rudd, fine art dealer of Southampton, I
am indebted for a considerable fund of information
relating to some of the exceptional examples of
old English earthenware which have passed through
his hands, and I am under a similar obligation to
Mr. S. G. Fenton, who has contributed some fine
pieces as illustrations to this volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. James Davies, of Chester, has given me access
to his collection, and has added some fine examples
which are here included as illustrations. Mr. F. W.
Phillips, of Hitchin, has from his fine collection
made a generous selection of noteworthy specimens.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Duncan, of Penarth, has included photographs
of some especially fine Swansea ware.</p>

<p>By the kindness of Mr. Hubert Gould, I am
reproducing some typical examples of transfer-printed
jugs from his collection of old earthenware.</p>

<p>To other friends who have generously forborne
with my inquiries, and lent me their practical aid
in various directions in assisting me to prosecute
my researches in attempting to arrive at definite
conclusions in regard to points not hitherto determined,
I tender my warm appreciation of their
kindness.</p>

<p>I may say, in conclusion, that a good photographer
is a treasure, and no trouble has been spared by Mr.
A. E. Smith, the well-known art photographer, to
render difficult subjects pictorially attractive in
conditions exceptionally detrimental to his art.</p>

<h2><a name="GLOSSARY" id="GLOSSARY"></a>GLOSSARY</h2>

<ul class="index">
<li class="bib">
<b>Agate Ware.</b>&mdash;Earthenware made either "solid" or
in "surface" decoration to resemble the veinings
of agate and other natural stones. The "solid"
agate ware is produced by layers of different
coloured clays being twisted together and cut
transversely. The "surface" agate ware is
splashed and grained decoration on an ordinary
cream body.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Astbury Ware.</b>&mdash;A generic term applied to specimens
in the manner of the Astburys, with raised
floral decoration of white on a red unglazed
body.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Basalt.</b>&mdash;Black Basalt, or "Egyptian" ware, is a solid
black stoneware of great hardness, made by
Wedgwood and by his school of followers.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Biscuit.</b>&mdash;This term is applied to earthenware and
porcelain when it has been fired once. It is
after the biscuit stage that decorations in colour
are applied, and the specimen goes to the oven
a second time (see <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></li>

<li class="bib"><b>Body.</b>&mdash;The body of a piece of earthenware is the
clay of which it is composed irrespective of the
nature or colour of decoration applied to its
surface.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>China.</b>&mdash;This term is applied to porcelain of all
classes, whether true porcelain of hard paste, <i>e.g.</i>,
Chinese, Japanese, Meissen, Plymouth, Bristol,
&amp;c., or artificial porcelain of soft paste, <i>e.g.</i>,
S&egrave;vres (<i>p&acirc;te tendre</i>), Worcester, Chelsea, Bow,
Lowestoft, &amp;c.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>China Clay.</b>&mdash;The whitest clay known. Obtained in
England from Devon and Cornwall. Used for
porcelain, and also for light-coloured earthenware.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>China Stone.</b>&mdash;Known also as Cornish stone; used in
conjunction with the china clay for porcelain,
and employed for stoneware bodies.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Cream Ware.</b>&mdash;This term applies to all light-coloured
English earthenware from about 1750 to the
present day. It varied in character from the
Queen's Ware of Josiah Wedgwood, 1760, to
the "chalk body" used by Wilson at the end of
the eighteenth century. Cream ware of later
date when broken shows a pure white body&mdash;a
puzzling fact to beginners in collecting.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Delft Ware.</b>&mdash;A generic term given to earthenware
with tin enamelled surface. True Delft ware
was made at Delft in Holland after 1600, but it
was successfully imitated at Lambeth, Bristol,
Liverpool, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></li>

<li class="bib"><b>Earthenware.</b>&mdash;All ware may be termed earthenware
which when in the <i>biscuit</i> state is too porous for
domestic use but requires a coating of glaze.
As a rule, earthenware is opaque, differing in this
respect from porcelain, which is translucent.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Enamel Colours.</b>&mdash;The colours applied either in
painted or printed decoration <i>over</i> the glaze.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Elers Ware.</b>&mdash;A generic term used in regard to unglazed
red stoneware with applied decoration
in the style of the Elers brothers.</li>

<li class="bib"><a id="Glaze"></a><b>Glaze.</b>&mdash;The glassy coating applied to earthenware
and porcelain.</li>

<li class="indx"><i>Lead-glaze.</i>&mdash;The earliest form used in England
was known as <i>galena glaze</i>, when sulphide
of lead was in powder form dusted on the
ware. Later liquid lead glaze was used,
into which the vessels were dipped.</li>

<li class="indx"><i>Salt-glaze.</i>&mdash;Common salt was thrown into the
kiln, and the resultant vapour deposited a
fine layer of glaze on the ware.</li>

<li class="indx"><i>Over-glaze.</i>&mdash;This term applies to painted or
printed decoration done <i>after</i> the glaze has
been applied to the object&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, over the
glaze.</li>

<li class="indx"><i>Under-glaze.</i>&mdash;This applies to decoration, painted
or printed, done <i>before</i> the glaze is applied
to the object&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, when completed the decoration
is under the glaze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></li>

<li class="bib"><b>Ironstone China.</b>&mdash;An earthenware for which Mason
took out a patent in 1813. The body contains a
large proportion of flint and slag of ironstone.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Jasper Ware.</b>&mdash;A fine hard stoneware used by
Wedgwood, and imitated by his followers. It
is unglazed.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Lustre Ware.</b>&mdash;Earthenware decorated by thin layers
of copper, gold, or platinum (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII.</a>).</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Marbled Ware.</b>&mdash;Ware of a similar nature to agate
ware, having its surface combed and grained to
imitate various natural marbles or granites.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Marks.</b>&mdash;In earthenware these makers' names or
initials or "trade marks" were usually impressed
with a metal stamp. Obviously this must have
been done when the ware was in plastic state;
therefore it is impossible to add such marks
after the ware is made, and when present on old
ware they are a sign of undoubted genuineness.
Of course a copy can be made bearing an impressed
mark.<br />

Painted or printed marks sometimes occur
on earthenware usually of a later date. Such
marks may be under-or over-glaze; the former
are not likely to have been added after the piece
has been made.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Modern.</b>&mdash;English earthenware may be termed
"modern" when it is of a later date than 1850.
Though, as is indicated in Chapter XIV., the
modern renaissance in earthenware should be of
especial interest to collectors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></li>

<li class="bib"><b>Over-glaze.</b>&mdash;See <a href="#Glaze"><i>Glaze</i></a>.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Oven.</b>&mdash;The "oven," as the potter terms it, is a
specially-built furnace in which the "saggers"
containing the ware are placed during the
firing (see <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>).</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Paste.</b>&mdash;This is another term for the "body" of the
ware.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>"Resist" Pattern.</b>&mdash;A term in silver lustre ware. For
detailed description see<a href="#CHAPTER_XIII"> Chapter XIII.</a></li>

<li class="bib"><b>Sagger.</b>&mdash;A fire-clay box in which the earthenware is
placed when being fired in the oven (see Illustration,
<a href="#Page_53">Chapter I.</a>).</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Salt-glaze.</b>&mdash;See <a href="#Glaze"><i>Glaze</i></a>, and see<a href="#CHAPTER_VI"> Chapter VI.</a></li>

<li class="bib"><b>Semi-china. Semi-porcelain.</b>&mdash;Terms applied to early
nineteenth century earthenware having a very
white or chalk body, and having the outward
appearance of china or porcelain. Strongly
imitative and false to the true qualities of
earthenware. It is always opaque. Sometimes
it is na&iuml;vely termed "opaque china."</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Slip.</b>&mdash;A thick semi-solid fluid composed of clay and
water.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Spurs. Spur mark.</b>&mdash;During the glazing of earthenware
"spurs" or "stilts" of fire-clay are used to
support the articles and keep them from touching
each other. "Spur" or "cockspur" marks are
found on the ware where it has rested on these
supports (see Chapter IX., <a href="#Page_298">p. 298</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></li>

<li class="bib"><b>Stoneware.</b>&mdash;A variety of pottery distinct from
earthenware, and more nearly approaching
porcelain in its characteristics. Earthenware,
as has been shown, needs a coating of glaze to
protect its porous defects. Stoneware is a hard
body needing no glaze. Glazed stoneware is
frequently found, and the glaze employed is
usually salt.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Throwing.</b>&mdash;The art of fashioning shapes on the
potter's wheel (see Illustration, <a href="#Page_49">Chapter I.</a>).</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Transfer Printing.</b>&mdash;Printing employed as a decoration
on ware by means of paper which had received a
design from a copper-plate, and was transferred
to the surface of the ware (see <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X.</a>).</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Under-glaze.</b>&mdash;See <a href="#Glaze"><i>Glaze</i></a>.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>"Wedgwood."</b>&mdash;This has become a generic term for
one or two classes of ware&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, jasper and black
basalt, which were made by most of the potters
succeeding Josiah Wedgwood. The word has,
in common with Boule and Chippendale become
popularly and erroneously used.</li>

<li class="bib"><b>Whieldon Ware.</b>&mdash;A generic term covering all classes
of ware of a mottled, cloudy, or splashed character&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
tortoiseshell plates, vases, figures,
&amp;c.</li></ul>

</p>


<p class="ph2">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="f75">HOW TO COLLECT: A CHAPTER FOR BEGINNERS</span></p>

<p class="chapblock">Reasons for collecting&mdash;What is earthenware?&mdash;How
earthenware is made&mdash;What to collect&mdash;Method of
studying old earthenware&mdash;Forgeries&mdash;Table for use
in identifying old English earthenware.</p>


<p>To attempt to advance reasons for collecting old
English earthenware is seemingly to commence this
volume with an apology on behalf of collectors. But
there are so many persons ready to throw a stone at
others who betray the possession of hobbies differing
from their own, that it is necessary to state that the
reasonable collection of old earthenware is based on
sound premisses.</p>

<p>Similar reasons may be given for the collection
of old English earthenware to those that may be
advanced for the collection of old English china.
Earthenware may be approached mainly from the
&aelig;sthetic side and studied with a view to show the
development of decorative art in this country and
the foreign influences which have contributed to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
evolution. The art of the old English potter is of
especial interest to students of ceramic art, as many
processes were invented in this country, and, in spite
of periods of decadence, English earthenware has
won for itself a considerable reputation on the Continent
from a technical point of view.</p>

<p>It may be collected as an adjunct to old furniture
by lovers of old furniture who are precisians in regard
to harmony in schemes of decoration. They prefer
to see china and earthenware of the same period as
the furniture. A modern set of vases adorning a
Georgian cabinet is like putting new wine into old
bottles. So that concomitant with the love for old
furniture, old pictures, and old prints is the accompanying
regard for contemporary china and earthenware.</p>

<p>The "drum and trumpet history" relating the
personal adventures of princes and nobles, and the
pomp of courts, or the intrigues of favourites, sets no
store on the apparent trivialities which mark the
social and intellectual progress of a nation. But the
scientific student of history cannot afford to ignore
the detailed study of social conditions which are
indicated by the china-shelf. The due appreciation
of the development of costume, of furniture, and of
the domestic arts gives life and colour to the written
records of byegone days. A mug or a jug with an
inscription may tell a story of popular party feeling
as pointedly as a broadsheet or a political lampoon.</p>

<p>The ordinary man sees in the collection of china
and earthenware an interesting hobby. He reads of
the prices remarkable specimens bring under the
hammer, and he begins to think that his education
has been partly neglected since he knows little or
nothing concerning these art treasures, which seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
are attractive to other men of culture and
means.</p>

<p>"Collecting for profit" is a phrase that tickles the
ears of many others. Undoubtedly there have been
many who have entered the field of collecting and
regarded their purchases solely as investments. It
must be borne in mind that this class of collector is
not to be despised, inasmuch as when he has mastered
his subject (and as there is money in it he very
speedily sets to work to do this) he is a very formidable
rival.</p>

<p>It is absurd to imagine that an amateur, after
having given especial study to a subject such as old
earthenware, is not in a better position to enter the
market as a buyer or a seller than he who comes
with little or no training.</p>

<p>It is only reasonable that a man should take an
intelligent interest in the evolution of the ware in
everyday use. But it is to be feared that long rows
of cases at the museum with specimens of earthenware
behind glass doors must necessarily be a valley
of dry bones to the spectator unless he bring the
seeing eye and the understanding heart to quicken
these dry bones into life.</p>

<p>Enough, perhaps, has been said as a prelude to
this volume to show that various reasons may be
advanced to account for the new spirit of collecting
which has become so infectious. It is the hope of
the writer that the following chapters, as an outline
of the subject of collecting old English earthenware,
may point the way to a better appreciation of what
is really of value in this field, and will enable the
collector in his search to sift the wheat from the
chaff, and him who already possesses <i>lares et penates</i>
of uncertain age to identify them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><b>What is Earthenware?</b>&mdash;To know what is earthenware
always puzzles the beginner. A rough-and-ready
means of determining the difference between
earthenware and porcelain is to apply the light test.
Porcelain more nearly approaches glass and is translucent&mdash;that
is, it clearly shows the shadow of the
hand holding it when placed up to the light. But
there are occasions when this test fails; for instance,
a block of porcelain may, as in a heavy figure, be so
thick as to render this experiment impossible. On
the other hand, fine stoneware may be partly translucent
in the thinner parts. In early nineteenth-century
days a class of ware, such as that of Mason,
is stamped "ironstone china" or "stone china." This
is earthenware of a peculiar nature, having certain
of the properties of porcelain. Similarly, at various
times earthenware has been made which nearly
approaches porcelain in its constituents. Dwight
with his stoneware busts and Wedgwood in his
jasper ware produced earthenware of such character
as to come close to the border line dividing earthenware
from porcelain.</p>

<p>The potter's art is divided into two sub-heads&mdash;porcelain
and earthenware&mdash;which latter, for purposes
of simplification, includes stoneware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="600" height="440" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A CORNER OF OLD ETRURIA WORKS.</div>

<div class="captionl"><i>By the courtesy of Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons.</i></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span></p>

<p>Earthenware is of soft body, is opaque&mdash;that is, it
cannot be seen through. Its thinness or its thickness
has nothing to do with its title. Stoneware
is equally opaque, but it is as hard as porcelain.
It may be as thick and heavy as a German
beer-mug or a stone ginger-beer bottle, or it
may be cream in colour, and thin as a Passover
cake, as in salt-glazed Staffordshire ware, or white
and heavy, as in later stone china. Porcelain
may be hard or soft and possesses properties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
equally its own, but is outside the scope of this
volume.</p>

<p>Practically earthenware is of such porous clay that
when fired in the kiln it is unfit for use, as it is
still too porous until it receives a coating of glaze.
Unglazed stoneware, Egyptian black, and Wedgwood's
jasper ware differ from earthenware in this
respect, as they do not receive any glaze, since they
are of dense enough body to be used in "biscuit"
or unglazed state.</p>

<p><i>Its appearance.</i> In colour earthenware may be
brown or white in exterior, or brown or white in
body as shown when broken. At its best its style
to the beginner may not be suggestive of great
difference between earthenware and porcelain.
Similar figures were attempted in the one material
as in the other. In France at Niderviller, at Marseilles,
and at Scieux the potters deliberately set
themselves to make objects in earthenware as delicate
and fanciful as were produced in hard porcelain at
Dresden or in soft porcelain at Vincennes. Clocks,
vases, sweetmeat-boxes, and elaborate dinner services
lavishly decorated in over-glaze enamels and gilded,
emulated the best work of the porcelain factories.
In Staffordshire the story has been repeated. So
that form is no guide as to what kind of ware a
piece may be. In weight earthenware is lighter than
porcelain as a general rule, though variations in the
body make this rule an elastic one. In stoneware,
and ware approximating to this in character, the
weight is heavier than porcelain. All ironstone ware
is exceedingly heavy.</p>

<p><i>Reasons for its appearance.</i> The earlier earthenware
was brown in body. The Dutch potters in the seventeenth
century covered their ware with an opaque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
white tin enamel to conceal the dark earthen body
and to enable them to paint on its surface in imitation
of Chinese porcelain. Stoneware, such as the
jugs of early type known as Bellarmines, is of very
vitreous earthenware fired so hard as to resist acids
or the use of a file when applied to the surface.
When glazed this class of ware has salt glaze.
Dwight, of Fulham, introduced white, or nearly
white, stoneware into England in his statuettes,
which induced him to claim that he had discovered
the secret of making porcelain. Cream ware followed
later, and, perfected by Wedgwood, it was adopted
as the standard earthenware of Staffordshire. It was
the last note in earthenware till the beginning of the
nineteenth century, when the Staffordshire potters
invented an earthenware with a white body more
nearly approaching porcelain in appearance. For
fifty years experiments had been carried on, and
this cream ware was whitened by a process called
"blueing" by the use of cobalt to whiten the lead
glaze. But the final invention was by Mason with
his patent ironstone china, in which he produced a
hard, white body.</p>

<p><b>How Earthenware is made.</b>&mdash;A good deal of theory
has found its way into print, but it is not every one,
even among collectors, who has actually seen the
various stages through which a lump of clay passes
before it finally takes its place on the table as a
teapot or a breakfast cup.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span></p>

<p>It has, therefore, been thought of interest to illustrate
a few steps in the process of this transformation
of clay into vessels of utility and beauty. By the
kindness of Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood and Sons, of
Etruria, this series of illustrations appears, and the
subjects have been chosen with a view to showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
those processes of the potter which are practically
the same as in the days of the great Josiah.</p>

<p>The first illustration (<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>) shows an <i>Exterior View
of the Etruria Works</i>, with the Cornish stone and
the ball clays from Dorset and Devon and the flints
lying in heaps exposed to the sun and frost in order
to "weather." This exposure is considered advantageous,
as the longer the clay is in the open the
better it will work when required for use.</p>

<p>The second illustration (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) shows a <i>Corner of
the old Etruria Works</i>. The structure is practically
the same as in the early days, and the bottom
windows on the right have remained unaltered.
The farthest at the bottom corner on the right
was the room of old Josiah.</p>

<p>The third illustration shows the <i>Mill for grinding
raw materials</i>. The clays are put into this vat and
crushed between two stones. There is nothing different
now from the early days. The old oak beams
tell their story. It is true that steam is now used,
but that is all to make this process differ from that
employed a century and a half ago&mdash;first when wind-power
was used, as in flour mills, and later when a
horse was substituted.</p>

<p>This grinding is done with water, and the mixture
comes out a thick liquid. The mixing-tank is the
next stage. These liquid constituents, such as ball
clay, china clay, flint, &amp;c., according to the formula
of the pottery, are carefully admitted into the tank
in correct proportions and thoroughly "blended"
together. The body is now in its "slip" state, and
is pressed and dried to make it more malleable when
not required for casting. In its later stage, in more
solid form, it is ready to be thrown on the potter's
wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Potter's Wheel.</b>&mdash;We illustrate (<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>) the ingenious
potter who is known as "The Thrower." It
is he who, on a little revolving table between his
knees pressed with his hands, magically transforms
the lump of clay into beautiful shapes. Unfortunately,
modern methods are eliminating the work
of "the thrower," whose art dates back to the
remotest past in the East when man first made
clay into objects of beauty. We find the prophet
Jeremiah saying, "Then I went down to the potter's
house, and behold he wrought a work on the wheel.
And the vessel that he made of clay was marred
in the hands of the potter, so he made again
another vessel as seemed good to the potter to
make it."</p>

<p>Old Omar Khayyam brings a moral to bear on
the potter and his wheel:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">"Surely not in vain</div>
<div class="i0">My substance from the common Earth was ta'en</div>
<div class="i1">That He who subtly wrought me into shape</div>
<div class="i0">Should stamp me back to common Earth again."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Shakespeare, not to miss a good simile, makes
one of his characters say, "My thoughts are whirled
like a potter's wheel."</p>

<p><b>The Pottery Kilns.</b>&mdash;The next stage is to convert
the vessel thrown in soft clay, and put aside to dry,
into being as a piece of pottery. There are three
ovens, termed the "biscuit," the "glost," and the
"enamel." In the illustration (<a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>) it is seen how
the vessels are put into "saggers," which are boxes
of fire-clay piled upon one another. The doorway
is bricked up and plastered, and gradually the
furnace is heated. Practically this "oven" illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is typical of the "biscuit" or the "glost"
oven, the difference being in the temperature applied,
the latter being at a much lower temperature.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to mention that a quick
oven is three days in firing and three days in cooling
before the ware is removed. For ornamental
and important specimens of a very special nature
as long a period as a month may be taken to fire
and half that time to cool. But of course this is
only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>It conjures up a picture of the awful anxiety of
some of the great master potters at the critical
moment when the doorway is pulled down and the
contents of the oven are drawn. It is here where
the triumph or the failure of the potter manifests
itself.</p>

<p>When taken out of the first oven the ware is
termed "biscuit." It is now ready for glazing. Of
course, in such ware as jasper or unglazed stoneware,
basalt, and similar kinds, the "biscuit" state
is the final one, the object being completed.</p>

<p><b>The Dipping-house.</b>&mdash;In the illustration (<a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>) it
will be seen that the ware in its "biscuit" state is
dipped in liquid glaze in a very deft manner, after
which it proceeds to the "glost" oven to harden this
glaze on its surface.</p>

<p>It is here that great care has to be exercised in
keeping the pieces from coming in contact with each
other; spurs and tripods are placed between each
piece to obviate this. The "saggers" in which this
newly-glazed ware is placed are dusted with material
infusible at the lower heat to prevent the pieces
adhering to these "saggers." In fact, as is readily
seen, a fine specimen may be easily ruined at any
stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In undecorated ware, as in the cream-ware examples
illustrated (<a href="#Page_225">p. 225</a>), this ends the process, and
they are complete. But in ware that is to be
decorated <i>over</i> the glaze there is yet another stage
before they are finished.</p>

<p>It will be observed that we are alluding to <i>over-glaze</i>
decoration. But ware may be painted before
being glazed,&mdash;that is <i>under-glaze</i>. In order, however,
not to confuse the beginner at the outset, this
has been described in a later chapter (<a href="#Page_326">p. 326</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Enamel Kiln.</b>&mdash;After the decorations have been
painted upon the glazed ware it has to be fired in
the enamel kiln. A far lower heat than that of the
"glost" oven is required; the flames do not pass
inside the kiln, as in an oven, but are led in flues
all round the kiln. We give an illustration (<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>)
of this for firing colours or gold <i>over</i> the glaze. As
will be seen, the pieces are carefully protected from
contact with each other, and at this last stage it is
quite possible to undo all the patient labour previously
employed and irretrievably ruin a piece.</p>

<p>In this hasty outline of the various processes of
the potter much has been omitted; but, in the
main, these illustrations should serve to kindle a
more intelligent interest, even among collectors, in
the earthenware and china which has passed through
so many critical periods in its life-history.</p>

<p><b>What to Collect.</b>&mdash;This is largely a question of
personal predilection. In general the field of English
earthenware may be divided into nine classes,
and the collector who wishes to specialise will have
his individual taste for one or more of these, according
as its technical or artistic qualities appeal to
him. This arrangement is mainly chronological,
but obviously one class will overlap others in point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of time. These classes are further summarised in
detail in the table intended for use in identifying
old earthenware given at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p><b>Method of studying old Earthenware.</b>&mdash;To those
readers who peruse this volume without any definite
idea of the standpoint of the collector it should not
be left unsaid that the proper study and collection
of old English earthenware require a considerable
amount of reading and, what is of much greater
importance, a very practical examination of some
hundreds of specimens. It is this practical experience
which alone can give the beginner the training
he requires. It is a complex subject bristling with
unexpected difficulties in regard to technical points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and crowded with apparent contradictions. The
bibliography given on <a href="#Page_23">pp. 23&ndash;25</a> will enable readers
to pursue special studies in greater detail.</p>

<p>The next best thing to handling the actual specimens
is to see them. It cannot here be impressed
upon the beginner too strongly that it is absolutely
necessary, in order to educate his eye, that the finest
known examples in the particular classes should be
frequently seen. The national museums, the Victoria
and Albert and the British, in London, both contain
splendid collections classified in a very thorough
manner. In the provinces, the following museums
among others contain fine collections, often of richer
interest in special subjects than the aforementioned.
For instance, the Public Museum at Liverpool contains
the most representative collection of the various
classes of Liverpool ware. The fine Art Gallery at
Leeds is rich in typical examples of the finest productions
in Leeds earthenware. At the Royal
Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, and at the Science
and Art Museum, Dublin, there are finely arranged
collections of pottery. At the Castle Museum,
Nottingham, at York, at Norwich, at Bath, at
Bristol, at Swansea, at Cardiff, at the Weston Park
Museum, Sheffield, at the Pitt-Rivers Museum,
Farnham, North Dorset, at the Grosvenor Museum,
Chester, at Maidstone, at Bury St. Edmunds, and
at Saffron Walden, there are collections which can be
studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span></p>

<p>In the district of the Potteries itself the following
museums have representative collections of special
varieties of Staffordshire ware. At Hanley, at
Tunstall, at Burslem, at Stoke-on-Trent, and at
Etruria, with its Wedgwood Museum, there is
material enough to be seen, so that it may be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that there is little need for the beginner to be starved
for want of opportunities to see fine examples.</p>

<p><b>Hints as to Prices.</b>&mdash;It is impossible in such a
complex subject as old earthenware to lay down
any hard and fast rules as to prices to be paid.
Specimens vary very considerably in quality, and
according to demand prices fluctuate as in other
markets.</p>

<p>If the beginner will make a point of learning his
subject and will keep in touch with a few dealers, he
will find that they will readily assist him to identify
his own specimens and systematically aid him in
adding judiciously to his collection. A great deal
of offensive nonsense has been written by fashionable
lady journalists, declaiming against the professional
dealer and crediting him with every conceivable trick
under the sun. But the greatest and the wisest of
collectors number a host of dealers as personal friends.
A continuous stream of good things passes through
the hands of the dealers who, by incessant handling
and practical study, are able and willing to help the
collector and to solve his difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Dealers' prices</i> are in many cases surprisingly low
considering the great trouble they have taken to
acquire the pieces. It is far better to procure
bargains in this manner, with one's personal knowledge
supplemented by the friendly suggestions of
one's favourite dealer, than to attempt to obtain
through private sources "great bargains" from
amateur dealers whose possessions would not, in
many cases, bear the light of day in the open
market.</p>

<p><b>Forgeries.</b>&mdash;There are many "faked" pieces in
existence, and there are many copies and a great
quantity of productions of factories of to-day who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
reproduce their old patterns made a century or more
ago. Some of this is made with intent to deceive,
and much is merely a trade movement to supply a
known want on the part of the public. But it is
exactly here that the dealer who has a respect for
his clients, and being a business man naturally does
not wish to ruin his reputation, may be of inestimable
value in advising the collector.</p>

<p>Mr. Solon, the eminent authority and a practical
worker in artistic pottery, tells in his "Art of the Old
English Potter" how, when he was searching for
fine specimens to make his collection, he was deceived
by some sham old slip ware bought at a high
figure in a lonely cottage in a remote district. If the
fabricator could lure so studious a collector into his
net, it goes without saying that especial precautions
should be taken by the beginner not to give large
prices unless he has a guarantee or knows the seller's
reputation.</p>

<p>Buyers of old delft ware should be careful in
examining the decoration of their purchases. Plain
ware, which is not so valuable and is comparatively
common, is decorated in blue, or a coat-of-arms and a
date added, giving a fictitious value to the piece. In
fact, such genuine dated pieces are worth ten times
the plain ones. Plain jars and jugs worth &pound;2 or &pound;3,
with the fraudulently added word "Sack" and the
initials "C. R." in blue, may tempt the unwary collector
to give &pound;20. It will thus be seen that this is
the most dangerous of frauds, and difficult to detect
unless the collector has handled many decorated
pieces, for the delft itself is absolutely genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">

<div class="caption">THE ENAMEL KILN.<br />

<span class="f90">Showing the ware after being enamelled stacked ready for firing.</span></div>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, plain pieces of genuine Staffordshire salt
glaze are enamelled in colours in order to enhance
the value, owing to the fashionable demand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
coloured examples. As much as &pound;50 has been
paid by an unfortunate collector for a teapot quite
worth this if genuine old colour work, but unhappily
it was, although fine old salt glaze, quite recently
coloured, evidently with fraudulent intentions.</p>

<p>Staffordshire figures that are modern tell their
own story, or should do so, to the collector who
has ever carefully examined the potting and the
glaze of fine old examples. Nor is there much
excuse for the blundering collector who cannot
readily distinguish between the crude modern Toby
jug with its blatant colouring, so smudgy and smeary
with black stains to impart age, and its genuine
prototype.</p>

<p>There are some fairly modelled Toby jugs, of
modern origin, one in particular seated in a corner
chair, with a salt-glaze surface. Another "fake"
appeals to the lover of the Whieldon style, and
has a mottled base and hat. But they are, as the
expressive term goes, "hot from the oven." The
"Vicar and Moses" was so well modelled by Ralph
Wood that it shared the fate of George Morland's
pictures which were copied by his contemporaries.
Ralph Wood's "Vicar and Moses" was copied all
through the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, and to-day modern fabrications repeat
the same model <i>ad nauseam</i>. Sham Voyez "Fair
Hebe" jugs, made for foolish collectors, are frequently
to be seen and avoided.</p>

<p>Leeds ware has engaged the attention of the
imitator. Some of the ware is made in Germany
and is unmarked. But other modern productions
exist stamped "Leeds Pottery," and are imitations
of the old Leeds patterns. There is a tobacco jar
in pewter having a shield with the Leeds coat-of-arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and raised medallions of a ship and of the
patron saint of the woolcombers. This jar has been
of late years copied in cream ware, and with its lid
with twisted handle it has passed as "genuine old
Leeds." But it is nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>In general, earthenware comes off better in regard
to forged marks than porcelain. In the latter, of
course, it is the easiest thing in the world to add
the marks, especially when most of them were <i>painted</i>.
But in earthenware the majority of marks were <i>impressed</i>
in the ware and this cheats the "faker" of
his quarry.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the mark should not lead the
collector by the nose. Before seeing any mark a
collector should begin to know his subject so well
that the mark is an additional piece of information
which serves to confirm his previous conclusions as
to the specimen under examination. An unmarked
example may show every evidence in modelling, in
paste, in colour, and in glaze, of having been made
by a certain potter at a particular date. The only
confirmation lacking is the mark. It is here that
marked ware becomes of paramount importance
for purposes of comparison. And it is better to
have a genuine marked piece in one's cabinet, from
a business point of view, than a genuine piece equally
fine that bears no signature or trade-mark. But this
craving on the part of collectors for marks has led in
the field of china to a disastrous state of things;
marks of one potter have been added to the productions
of another, and no fabricated Worcester
china is worth its salt as a correct piece of forgery
unless it bears the square mark or the crescent.</p>

<p>Happily, in earthenware the question of marks only
affects the ware from Wedgwood's day onwards. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
finest specimens of earthenware in the noted collections
throughout the country, of Elers, and Dwight
and Astbury, and Whieldon, and the whole salt-glaze
school bear no mark, for the very simple reasons that
the old potters had no "marks." But they signed
their pieces all over, and the touch of these old
masters is immediately intelligible to the trained
eye of the collector.</p>

<p><b>How to identify old Earthenware.</b>&mdash;The following
Table roughly summarises the field under which
English earthenware may be classified. It is the
hope of the writer that possessors of earthenware
which they are unable to identify will, by the help
of this Table, be able to place their pieces under the
sub-head to which they belong. The references given
to the chapters dealing with the classes in detail are
intended to point the way to a more extended
examination of specimens.</p>

<p>A good general rule for beginners in attempting
the proper identification is to commence by eliminating
all the classes of ware to which the piece obviously
cannot belong. Gradually the field becomes limited
to one period, and finally it is narrowed to two or
three factories. But it is only by practice that
definite and accurate conclusions can be arrived at.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ironstone body, which he termed
          <i>Felspar China</i>, <i>Stone China</i>, and on some

           Haynes, of the Cambrian Pottery, Swansea,
                              invented a similar opaque china at the end

                              white earthenware, floral painting by trained

                              patented his ironstone china, the jugs took
                              a new form, becoming octagonal, and their
                              corners were not easily broken as in the
                              chalkier body.<br />

Ware&mdash;Wrotham (Kent) (1656&ndash;1703)&mdash;Staffordshire
Makers (1660&ndash;1700)&mdash;Prices of Early Ware.</p>


<p>As will be seen from the table at the end of the preceding
chapter, the main body of English earthenware
to which collectors can give their attention,
belongs chiefly to the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries. The beginnings of pottery and the first
steps towards perfection in art are always interesting,
but in the realm of English pottery the beginner had
better push forward as the subject is a very complex
one, and the general collector is perforce obliged to
confine attention to the later periods.</p>

<p>It will therefore suffice if a hasty survey be made
of the chief earthenware prior to the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p><b>Medi&aelig;val Tiles.</b>&mdash;From the thirteenth century to
the dissolution of the monasteries the ecclesiastical
tiles used in England were of a particularly noticeable
character. The tiles vary in size, the earlier
ones, as at Chertsey Abbey, were not more than three
or four inches square. The earlier the tile, as a rule,
the smaller is its area. The tiles were ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in various ways. They had incised, raised, inlaid, or
painted patterns. The incised and relief tiles are the
most uncommon, probably being the earlier. The
designs are very numerous, and vary in character in
the different abbeys at which they originated. Specimens
have been found at Great Malvern, Denny
Abbey in Norfolk, Castle Acre Priory, Jervaulx
Abbey, Lewes Priory, St. Alban's Abbey, and at
Chertsey Abbey, which latter had "one of the finest,
if not the finest, inlaid tile pavement in existence"
(Hobson). The Chertsey tiles are of different shapes,
sometimes being round or half-circular to meet the
exigencies of the design, and in general they are
very quaint and original in their conception. The
British Museum has some fine examples of these
Chertsey tiles in composite pictures made up of
many tiles.</p>

<p>The designs found on medi&aelig;val tiles consist of
the figures of animals, mythical and heraldic, of birds,
of human heads and grotesques, as well as conventional,
floral, and geometric patterns. They are
highly artistic and of great technical excellence.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the monks made these
tiles themselves in the great religious houses, and
possibly some of them may have had foreign inspiration
or have been made here by foreigners. But as
the tiles at Malvern and at Chertsey are finer than
any found on the Continent it opens up a field for
conjecture. Mr. Solon says, "I have often thought
that considering the French pavements of the
earliest periods have mostly been found in the provinces
then under English domination, it would be
worth while inquiring whether the art of tile-making
had not been imported from England&mdash;a point which
has never yet been sifted."</p>

<p>So here, then, is a subject ready to hand for the
collector willing to specialise in a branch of ceramic
study and collecting not greatly inquired into, and
the way has already been pointed out by experts.
There is every reason why these ecclesiastical tiles
should be studied with as much assiduity as are the
Bristol delft painted tiles and those of Liverpool.</p>

<p><b>Slip Ware.</b>&mdash;This ware is peculiarly English and
owes little or nothing to any foreign influences, as
no ware like it has ever been made on the Continent.
White or light-coloured clay was used in the form of
"slip," that is, a mixture of water and clay of such
consistency as to be dropped in fanciful pattern upon
the darker body of the ware much in the same
manner as the confectioner ornaments his wedding-cakes
with sugar. Candlesticks, cups, tygs (drinking
vessels having several handles for use in passing
round), posset-pots, jugs, besides the large ornamental
dated dishes by Toft and others were all
made of this slip-decorated ware.</p>

<p><b>Wrotham, in Kent</b>, claims superiority in the manufacture
of this ware, of which many pieces exist. The
earliest Wrotham specimen is dated 1656 (Maidstone
Museum). There are other dated pieces, one as early
as 1621, of red clay with more elaborate slip decoration
than is found in Staffordshire and elsewhere,
and in some cases with fine incised decoration cut
through the white dip and exposing the red body
beneath. But considerable doubt exists as to whether
to ascribe some of this slip ware to Kent or to
Staffordshire. It is probable that it was made at
many other places, certainly in Derbyshire, in Wales,
and in London. As some undoubted Wrotham
pieces betray a slightly advanced type of decoration
although prior in date to other pieces made elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it has been fairly conjectured that the style originated
in Kent, and was brought thither by some foreign
refugees from the Continent. But as it became
practised more generally in England it assumed a
national character entirely its own, and took to itself
a quaint humour racy of the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Toft Ware.</b>&mdash;The names of Ralph Toft and Thomas
Toft appearing on certain large dishes, usually about
eighteen inches in diameter, decorated in slip in a
somewhat crude manner, have given the name to
this class of ware, which at best is peasant pottery.
The Tofts had their works near Shelton in Staffordshire.
Similar dishes were made at Derby and at
Tickenhall. The following names occur on examples
in the National and other collections with dates,
Ralph Toft, Thomas Toft, 1671; Robert Shaw,
1692; William Chaterly, 1696; Ralph Turnor, 1681;
William Talor, 1700; John Wright, 1707; initials
S. M., 1726, <i>Dublin Museum</i> (possibly Samuel Mayer,
of Derby); John Wenter, 1686; I. W., 1706. The
manufacture of this slip ware continued, in more or
less spasmodic manner, throughout the eighteenth
century. Pots and jugs had illiterate inscriptions on
them in halting verse, or pious mottoes.</p>

<p>Toft ware, that is, the large dish form, apparently
was made solely for ornament. There is a remarkable
Toft dish in the Grosvenor Museum at Chester,
having the inscription in Toft's peculiar orthography,
"Filep Heues, Elesabeth Heues" (Philip and Elizabeth
Hughes), signed Thomas Toft and dated 1671.
This is evidently a marriage plate. There is the royal
arms above, a favourite design in Toft ware, probably
copied from some of the more elaborate foreign
Bellarmine jugs. The slip potters had a fondness
too for royal portraiture which ended lamentably in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
becoming dreadful caricatures of the subject. As
many as nine crowned heads are found on one
dish by Ralph Toft, signed "Ralalph To." These
have as much art as the Stuart stump-work pictures
in needlework, which were contemporary with them,
in which kings and queens were represented in no
more pleasing manner than on a pack of cards. In
speaking of Toft's portrait dishes in general, and of
the Grosvenor Museum example in particular, Mr.
Frank Freeth, no mean connoisseur, says, "It must
not be forgotten that these dishes were ornamental,
and intended to occupy a conspicuous place in the
homes of loyal citizens, just as oleographs of the
King and Queen, that one often sees in country
cottages, are made for the purpose in the present day.
The same idea has remained; but the form of its
expression has changed."</p>

<p>Looking at slip ware as a whole, one must not be
too critical in regard to its somewhat inartistic
appearance. It certainly has a charm about it which
cannot be denied. It is native to the soil, and this
peasant industry (if one can appropriately term it
such), is chiefly to be regarded from the standpoint
of what might have been if it had been allowed to
develop on natural and untrammelled lines. But it
was pressed on the one side by stoneware, such as
the Bellarmine jugs and mugs imported from
Germany, and it finally succumbed to foreign delft,
which was largely used here prior to the Englishman's
determined attempt, at Lambeth, at Bristol,
and at Liverpool (where it was the staple industry
for some time) to make his own wares.</p>

It is the same story with the fine stoneware, the
salt glaze of Staffordshire, which was a magnificent
outburst of English art of the highest order, which<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
fell before the cheapness of Wedgwood's and other
cream ware, after a heroic struggle in its enamelled
stage with the coloured ware of the new English
china factories. These precedents might be continued
further up to the present day, when German,
Austrian, and Japanese competition have driven
English potters into the position of attempting to
hold their own against foreign art.

<p>It is the opinion of the present writer that the
coats-of-arms on the Toft dishes were a deliberate
attempt to copy those frequently found on the belly
of the Rhenish stoneware jugs. From the days of
Elizabeth coats-of-arms and heraldic devices were a
feature in these jugs used in this country. Among
those at the British and the Victoria and Albert
Museums, and in the fine collection at the Guildhall,
the use of crests is seen to be a striking characteristic
(see illustration, <a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>). As a conclusive proof that
the maker of earthenware had his eye on these stoneware
models, we give as an illustration a jug in
<i>earthenware</i> (not stoneware) of Bellarmine form made
in England, undoubtedly by an English potter. The
arms on it are those of the Earl of Dorset, not improbably
those of the sixth Earl, Charles Sackville,
who lived from 1637 to 1706, and was the author of
the well-known song, running&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a sort of heraldic touch about some of
these Staffordshire dishes of the Toft class. The
same idea seems to have possessed the workers of the
Stuart stump-pictures in needlework, which were
contemporary with these dishes. Coins and medals
and Stuart marriage-badges are evidently the source
from which Toft and his school on the one hand, and
the gentle needlewoman on the other, derived their
inspiration in design. Various animals and birds are
used symbolically with great freedom. The caterpillar
and butterfly nearly always accompany needlework
portraits of Charles I., and the unicorn was the
device of his father James I. There seems some
similarity to this idea in the use of the <i>Mermaid</i> in
the dish by Thomas Toft. Another dish of his,
entitled "The Pelican in her Piety," depicts that bird
with her young, the idea being that the pelican used
to feed her brood with her own blood. The Latins
called filial love <i>piety</i>, hence Virgil's hero is always
termed <i>pius Aeneas</i>. "Ralph Simpson" is another
name found on this pelican dish.</p>

<p>We give an illustration of a fine posset-pot of
Staffordshire origin, dated 1685, in slip ware, with
yellow ground and conventional ornament in brown,
with dotted work. It is inscribed, "William Simpson,
His Cup." It has three handles and three loops, and
is quite a typical piece of this class of ware. It
recently sold for fifty-five pounds (<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>).</p>

<p><i>Metropolitan Slip Ware.</i>&mdash;There is a slight distinction
between pieces made in London and found
during excavations, and those discovered elsewhere.
The slip decoration is lightly done and there is a
tendency to incised decoration of conventional floral
design. One noticeable feature in this type of ware
is its inscriptions, written in doggerel, always of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
pious nature. "When this you see, Remember me,&mdash;Obeay
God's word"; or "Drink faire, Don't sware";
or "Be not hyminded but feare God, 1638." This
class of ware savours strongly of the Puritan influence,
and it is evident that the potters who made these
pieces were of the "Praise God Barebones" order of
visionary, not uncommon at a time when books with
titles like the following appeared, "Some fine Baskets
baked in the Oven of Charity, carefully conserved for
the Chickens of the Church, the Sparrows of the
Spirit, and the sweet Swallows of Salvation."</p>

<p>It seems absurd in regarding the productions of
this school of English slip workers, from middle Stuart
days down to the early years of the eighteenth century,
to consider that Vandyck had painted his galleries of
beauties; that Hollar, with his etching needle, had
drawn a long procession of figures in costume,
thousands of etchings which surely must have caught
the eye of some Toft or some Simpson. There was
Grinling Gibbons working his artistic profusion in
wreaths of flowers and fruit carved in wood, and there
were the treasures of the silversmith, to say nothing
of the sumptuous furniture that was beginning to
make its way in England. But these slip ware dishes
seem to stand somewhat like the Jacobean chairs
made in Yorkshire and Derbyshire, of the same date,
apparently unaffected by any of the &aelig;sthetic movements
of the period. Simply and naturally, and, be it
said, crudely representing the artistic aspirations of
the ordinary craftsman when he was left to himself,
it is <i>na&iuml;ve</i>, standing as it does for English native art
at a time when Bernard Palissy, the French potter,
had been dead a hundred years.</p>

and Green&mdash;Wincanton (Somerset)&mdash;Prices of English
Delft</p>


<p>Delft, of all earthenware, is, so to speak, the most
earthen, and presents an object lesson to the student.
It accurately conforms to the technical definition as
to what constitutes the difference between earthenware
and porcelain. It consists of a porous body (in
the case of Dutch delft very porous, as we shall see
later), covered by a thick coating of white, opaque
enamel.</p>

<p>The porous nature of its body makes it light in
weight, and the tin enamel which covers the brown
body enables the potter to paint upon this white
surface designs, usually in blue. This decoration is
over the enamel, if it were under this opaque enamel,
that is, on the brown underneath body of the ware,
the coating of this white enamel would obliterate the
designs. After a piece has been fired to the biscuit
state and dipped in white enamel and painted upon
when dry, it is, to preserve the painting, fired a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
time, when it receives a thin surface of transparent
lead glaze.</p>

<p><b>Its Foreign Origin.</b>&mdash;Its name is derived from the
town of Delft in Holland. It was about the year
1602 that Dutch potters invented this class of ware
in their attempts, in common with all the other
European potters, to produce some ware as decorative
as the porcelain which had been brought to Europe
long before by the Portuguese traders, and now was
being largely imported by the East India Dutch
merchants.</p>

<p>This first employment of a white enamel on a
brown earthenware was clearly due to the very
natural desire on the part of the potter to procure
some surface upon which his decorations in colour
would show well in contrast. All primitive potters
have passed through several stages of evolution.
Brown ware was at first plain, then it received
scratched or incised decoration. Searching for
greater contrast the potter applied his ornament in
relief in white, as in slip ware, or he added coloured
glazes, as in the Tudor miniature jugs.</p>

<p>But it seems that sooner or later the light background
for the painted decoration must have become
an ideal to strive for. It is, in effect, the same
necessity which induces the signboard painter to
cover his brown panel with a white background prior
to painting in letters of red or blue some attractive
announcement. But with the models of the Chinese
potter now constantly before him the Dutch potter
commenced at once to imitate them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>

<p>But pleasing as is the Dutch delft in its fine
colours, incorporated as they are with the enamel and
glaze and giving the rich tone so much admired by
collectors, and faithfully copying the form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Nankin models, it falls short of these Oriental prototypes
in many important respects. It is admittedly
an imitation of the <i>appearance</i> of porcelain, and not an
imitation of the qualities peculiar to porcelain. The
Dutch potter in his delft did not, as in the case of
other European potters, essay to copy the body of
porcelain, and arrive at true hard white paste, as did
Meissen. Apparently he took his earthenware, and
with the limitations in technique in its working he
produced a colourable imitation, in appearance only,
of his blue and white Chinese models, and very fine
some of these early seventeenth century Dutch delft
pieces are, and highly prized by collectors.</p>

<p>But delft in comparison with porcelain may be said
to be very similar to veneered furniture in relation to
solid specimens. The veneer in the one case and the
enamel in the other disguises something inferior
beneath.</p>

<p><b>Introduction into England.</b>&mdash;There is no doubt that,
prior to its manufacture in this country, a great
quantity of Dutch delft was imported and in general
use in the middle years of the seventeenth century.
In dealing with delft ware, in connection with the
various types of earthenware at different periods of
the history of the potter's art it must be borne in
mind that delft was entirely of foreign origin. It
owed everything to the inventiveness of the Dutch
potters, and it gained very little when it became
acclimatised in England, although it was manufactured
here until the closing years of the eighteenth
century, when Wedgwood's cream ware drove it off
the market as a cheap and serviceable ware.</p>

<p>Naturally the close connection of the royal house
of England with Holland accelerated the fashion of
storing delft in closets and making considerable use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of its rich colours as a decorative effect on sideboards
and buffets. The lac cabinets and the fine blue and
white delft jars at Hampton Court testify to the
influence that the advent of William of Orange
had on the taste of the country from the memorable
year of 1688, when he landed at Torbay.</p>

<p>Delft was presumably being made in this country
fifty years before that by Dutch refugees, but the
thirties of the seventeenth century was not a very
happy time to inaugurate the birth of a new branch
of art in England. The rumblings of the civil war
were in the air. It was in 1642 that Charles precipitated
matters by going with an armed force to the
House of Commons to arrest five members; and
seven years later he lost his head in Whitehall. It
is not until the last years of Charles II. that there
appears to be any documentary evidence connected
with the actual manufacture of delft in England.
John Ariens van Hamme, evidently a Dutch refugee,
a potter working at Lambeth, took out a patent for
making "tiles and porcelain after the way practised in
Holland." The word "porcelain" was used somewhat
indiscriminately at this date and apparently meant
anything having the appearance of the wares coming
over in large numbers from the East, imported by our
East India Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Lambeth Delft.</b>&mdash;To Lambeth must be accredited
the best results of English delft ware. The glaze is
thinner and whiter than is used elsewhere and the
tone of the blue is less crude. It is difficult to
differentiate between the work of Dutch refugees and
of English born potters. Drug pots and sack bottles
formerly imported from Holland began to be made at
Lambeth. Some of these bottles are dated and the
dates upon them range from 1649, the year of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
execution of King Charles I., to 1664, during the
early years of the reign of Charles II., the year in
which New York, then New Amsterdam, a Dutch
settlement, was surrendered to the English.</p>

<p>There are not a great number of these authentic
dated sack bottles known. Lambeth must also be
credited with the series of plates having dates and
initials, and with some of the "blue dash" chargers or
dishes. These are usually decorated with blue dashes
clumsily applied round the edge, sometimes brown is
used instead of blue. In the centre of the dish is
generally a figure, often on horseback, and the foliage
of the trees in the background is done with a sponge
hastily applied. The range of colours used is not
great&mdash;blue, green, orange, puce, and brown. Sometimes
four colours are found on one dish, but not
infrequently the decorator has been content with two,
in addition to blue, which is nearly always present.</p>

<p>The following are among the subjects found on
these dishes, which are usually about thirteen inches in
diameter:&mdash;Charles I., Charles II., James II., William
and Mary, William on foot or on horseback, Queen
Anne, the Old Pretender, Duke of Marlborough,
Duke of Monmouth, and the celebrated Adam and
Eve dishes, in which Eve was represented as Queen
Mary giving a kingdom to her husband, represented
by an orange as a pun on his royal house. Although
portraits of Charles I. appear in this series, they
are not contemporary, and were probably not made
at Lambeth until after about 1670, and their manufacture
continued for a little over a quarter of a
century, that is, until the opening years of the reign
of George I.</p>

<p>That delft was made in England a little earlier
than 1672 is proved by the fact that in that year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a royal proclamation forbade the importation of
"painted earthenware" to compete with the same
production "but lately found out in England." Here
is an instance of trade protection, but it should be
borne in mind at that date we were at war with the
Dutch, who were in that year defeated off Southwold
Bay.</p>

<p>Something should be said about the characteristics
of this Lambeth delft. The body is fairly hard and
the tin enamel or glaze is often found on the back of
the piece; when this is not the case the back has
received an application of yellowish lead glaze. The
English clay being less spongy than that of Holland,
did not take the enamel well, and often shows the
colour of the body in pink lines through the glaze.
English delft, owing to the glaze not being incorporated,
is crazed on the surface. In regard to dated
sack bottles, great caution should be exercised in
buying them, as genuine examples of plain undated
bottles have been skilfully redecorated by fraudulent
hands, and the words Sack or Canary, together with
a date, added.</p>

<p>There is an element of doubt about much of the
Lambeth delft ware, as it is certain that some of the
patterns were copied by the Staffordshire potters,
and some of these copies are so faithfully done as to
puzzle experts, but many of the cruder dash series
of dishes and platters may safely be attributed to
Staffordshire.</p>

<p>In the illustration of a dated candlestick, with the
initials W.E. and coat of arms, and dated 1648,
from the National collection at the Victoria and
Albert Museum, it will be seen that the authorities
attribute an earlier date to the manufacture of
delft at Lambeth than the above-mentioned royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
proclamation in 1672 would seem to warrant. But
so learned an authority as Professor Church is of
the opinion that "a considerable manufactory
existed there at least as early as 1631." It is
interesting to compare the style of this delft candlestick
with a brass one of early Dutch manufacture,
which at any rate shows that the design, as well
as the method of manufacture, was derived from
Holland.</p>

<p>Pharmacy jars, decorated in blue and plain white
delft, were also made at Lambeth; of this latter there
are many small jugs and puzzle jugs, and a variety of
fancy pieces. We give an illustration of a very
interesting Pharmacy Jar with the arms of the
Apothecaries' Company, and with motto inscribed.
A shield below has the arms of the City of London.</p>

<p><b>Bristol Delft.</b>&mdash;There is no doubt that the delft of
Bristol has not yet been thoroughly exploited.
Farther removed from the influence of a constant
stream of Dutch examples, the potters took some
of their designs straight from Oriental models.
Richard Frank and Joseph Flower are two potters
who had works at Bristol. They are known to have
manufactured delft as early as the opening years
of the eighteenth century, contemporary with Lambeth,
when the industry at this latter place was in
full swing, and delft was made at Bristol until the
middle of the reign of George III., after which delft
was no longer fashionable.</p>

<p>It is not easy to distinguish between the productions
of Frank and Flower, nor is it less difficult in
some instances to state definitely whether a piece is
Bristol, or Liverpool, or Lambeth, and we might
add Staffordshire. There is a very interesting delft
plate decorated in blue, representing a balloon ascent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
In date this is about 1784 and it may be attributed
to Bristol or Liverpool (see illustration, <a href="#Page_107">p. 107</a>).</p>

<p>But as a rule it is held that Bristol delft is
bluish in tint, and has a more brilliant and
even surface. The ware is decorated with Oriental
landscapes, and a considerable number of tiles
were made and painted for use as pictures in the
fireside in old Bristol houses a century and a half
ago. Bowen, John Hope, Michael Edkins, and
Thomas Patience are some of the painters who
worked at the Frank pottery. There is one subject
picture representing Hogarth's <i>March to Finchley</i>,
and it was certainly executed more than once as
there is one set consisting of forty-two tiles and
another of seventy-two tiles of the same subject.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of some of the Bristol delft is the
ground of powdered purple or brown with white
panels, having a decoration in blue. We illustrate a
bowl of this type of ware, which, although not having
the white panel, is representative of this class as the
fish is on a white ground with outline decorations in
blue (see <a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>).</p>

<p>Another fine style of decoration is that known as
<i>bianco sopra bianco</i>, that is, a pattern of foliage or
sprays of flowers enamelled in white upon a dull,
greenish-white ground (see illustration, <a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>).</p>

<p>There are many dated pieces of Bristol delft with
initials, bowls, marriage and election plates, and
sometimes tile pictures. At the Victoria and Albert
Museum there is a fine plate with the initials E.M.B.,
and dated 1760, the initials being those of the
painter, Michael Edkins, and his wife Betty. This
was made at the factory of Richard Frank, and was
presented to the National collection by the grandson
of the painter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>In the collection of pottery at the Bristol Museum
there is an example attributed to Brislington which
in colouring is slightly duller than the Bristol
examples. Connoisseurs of Bristol delft divide the
ware into the earlier period prior to 1735, when the
decoration followed Dutch prototypes, and they
attribute much of the thinner or finer potted
examples to Joseph Flower, but after that the
Bristol potters struck out for themselves, and
imparted more originality in their ware. Landscapes
appeared on the ware, but not seen through
Dutch eyes, and a slight variation was given to the
form of the bases of the bowls and plates, falling into
line with typical shapes employed by other English
potters.</p>

<p>We illustrate a very remarkable piece of Bristol
delft which is dated 1740, and bears the initials I.F.,
which may probably stand for Joseph Flower, whose
factory was on the quay at Bristol. This plate,
which is 13&frac12; inches in diameter, has a painted
illustration with the inscription in a medallion, "A
Voyage to the Moon, by Domingo Gonsales from the
Ile of Tenerife."</p>

<p>We do not know what is the particular story connected
with the making of this plate, nor why such a
subject should have been chosen. But there is no
doubt that the painter of the plate took his design
from a book entitled "The Man in the Moone, or a
Discourse of a Voyage thither, By Domingo Gonsales,
The Speedy Messenger." We give a facsimile of the
title-page. This was a romance written by Francis
Godwin, bishop of Hereford, and in the second
edition of 1657, the title-page has the addition, "By
F.G.&mdash;B. of H." There were many editions of this
book, which became very popular. A French edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
under the title of <i>L' Homme dans La Lune</i>, is
dated 1671, and has the same illustration as the first
English edition, with the exception of the inscription
on the medallion.</p>

<p>This is not the place to give details of this interesting
volume, which describes in language as faithful as
that of Defoe, the voyage of Domingo Gonsales, a
shipwrecked Spanish adventurer, from Teneriffe to the
Moon in a car he invented, which was carried by a
flock of wild geese he had trained in his solitude.
After a stay of a year in that country, and meeting
with adventures with the inhabitants of that
kingdom, he sets sail for the earth and lands in
China. He by great fortune hears of some Jesuit
fathers hidden away in Far Cathay, who welcomed
him, "much wondering to see a lay Spaniard there,"
and by them his story is committed to writing.</p>

<p>Written in 1638, the following sentence in the
<i>Preface</i> sounds quite modern, "That there should be
Antipodes was once thought as great a paradox as
now that the Moon should be habitable. But the
knowledge of this may seem more properly reserved
for this, our discovering age." There is no doubt
that the book had a very considerable circulation,
and it is not improbable that Swift knew of it and
incorporated some of the ideas of the author in his
"Gulliver's Travels," which appeared in 1726. But
it is not easily explained why this delft plate, dated
1740, bears the inscription and illustration of a volume
published nearly a century earlier.</p>

<p><b>Liverpool Delft.</b>&mdash;Collectors of Liverpool delft
would like to ascribe many pieces to that city. But,
unfortunately, the difference between this and the
other English delft is not so defined. One has to
take the style of subject largely as a guide for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
origin. There is a large punch bowl at the Victoria
and Albert Museum which may certainly be attributed
to Liverpool. It was painted by John Robinson at
Seth Pennington's factory. A similar bowl is in the
Mechanic's Institution at Hanley. It is painted in blue
with a three-masted man-of-war inside the bowl. The
flag is touched with red. The exterior shows an
array of military trophies. It is somewhat confusing
to collectors to know that the fine punch bowls of
Seth Pennington, with his renowned blue colouring,
are of delft, earthenware, and of <i>china</i>. These latter
are of great rarity and value.</p>

<p>Another maker of delft punch bowls was Shaw,
but it is not easy to determine with exactitude to
which factory to ascribe some of these delft bowls,
and there is room for considerable inquiry and
exhaustive research to be made into the early history
of the Liverpool potteries in general, as much information
is needed to settle controversial points.</p>

<p><b>Delft Printed Tiles.</b>&mdash;It is here that Liverpool
stands pre-eminent in the transfer printed delft tiles.
As early as 1750 Sadler and Green discovered the
transfer printing by means of adhesive paper placed
on previously inked copper-plates and laid on the
earthenware as a decoration in black or in red, and
sometimes puce. The signature of the engravers
appears on some specimens, <i>J. Sadler, Liverpool</i>;
<i>J. Sadler, Liverpl.</i>; <i>Sadler, Liverpool</i>; <i>Green,
Liverpool</i>; or <i>Green</i>.</p>

<p>The invention was invaluable as a decoration for
china and earthenware in lieu of painting. The
following affidavit was made in 1756 by John Sadler
and Guy Green that they "without the aid of or
assistance of any other person or persons, did, within
the space of six hours, to wit, betwixt the hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
nine in the morning and three in the afternoon of the
same day, print upwards of 1,200 tiles of different
patterns at Liverpoole aforesaid, and which, as these
deponents have heard and believe, were more in
number, and better and neater, than one hundred
skilled potmakers could have painted in the like
space of time in the common or usual way of
painting with a pencil, and these deponents say that
they have been upwards of seven years in finding out
the method of printing tiles, and in making tryals and
experiments for that purpose, which they have now,
through great pains and expense, brought to
perfection."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this invention revolutionised
the decoration of all wares. In regard to
the controversy which has arisen as to the prior
claims of Battersea for its transfer decorated
enamels, and of Worcester for similar decorations
by Hancock, the whole matter has been exhaustively
dealt with by Mr. William Turner in
his "Transfer Printing on Enamels, Porcelain, and
Pottery," in which the case for each claimant is
minutely analysed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span></p>

<p>Sadler and his partner Green conducted a large
business in this transfer printing for other factories
as well as, of course, for the Liverpool delft and
other wares. Sadler apparently left the partnership
somewhere between 1769 and 1774, so that the
signature on the tiles by him gives the date of
their printing. Green carried on the business until
1799, and so great was the fame of the firm that
cream ware was sent from Etruria and by other
Staffordshire potters to be printed at Liverpool, and
up till 1799 Wedgwood's successors still continued the
practice of having their cream ware printed by Green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Liverpool tiles obviously differ from Bristol tiles
inasmuch as the former were printed after 1756, but
of course before that date Liverpool delft tiles must
have been painted as they were elsewhere. There
are many series of the Sadler and Green period, one
notable one being a number of actors and actresses,
including Garrick, Foote, Mrs. Abington, Mrs. Yates,
and others, in character.</p>

<p>Fable illustrations from &AElig;sop and others were
largely printed, and some of Wedgwood's plates
have been decorated in red, with fable subjects
some five inches square, which, in spite of the
festoons in which they are set, cannot escape from
seeming what they are&mdash;square tile-subjects applied
to the decoration of a round plate&mdash;and the result is
not pleasing.</p>

<p>Among the signed pieces of Sadler and of Green, if
any difference in style can be discerned in the results,
it is indicated by the subjects they chose. Sadler's
name appears on pastoral subjects with luxurious
foliage and with dainty rustic scenery, while Green
seems to have had a fondness for Oriental groups
with a framework of fantastic furniture. The best
collection of Liverpool delft in this country is in the
museum at Liverpool.</p>

<p>At this museum may be seen the printed work
on delft tiles of a later Liverpool potter, Zachariah
Barnes, who was only twelve years of age when
Sadler and Green commenced their tile printing,
but who lived till 1820, and had a considerable
business in printing wall tiles of fine character.</p>

<p><b>Wincanton Delft.</b>&mdash;A delft factory existed at Wincanton
(Somerset), and recent excavations have
brought to light material proving the class of ware
made there. Nathaniel Ireson is believed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
started the works about 1730. There are examples
of this delft bearing the name "Wincanton," and
dated 1737. One specimen has the name Nathaniel
Ireson, and is dated 1748. One of these dated plates
is in the National Scottish Museum at Edinburgh,
which we are enabled to reproduce as an illustration.
It is decorated in blue, with the arms of the
Masons' Company, and inscribed "Js. Clewett," and
dated 1737. At the back of the dish are painted
sprays of blossom, and it is marked "Wincanton."
This is a remarkable specimen.</p>

<p><b>Tudor Jugs.</b>&mdash;Though earliest in date, we mention
this last, as the ware is not true delft. This is a class
of Elizabethan ware, mostly small jugs some five or
six inches in height, of brown-and-blue mottled surface.
The exterior has all the appearance of Cologne
stoneware, but the pieces bear a closer relationship
to delft; they have a tin glaze, whereas the stone
Cologne ware has a salt glaze. They are exceedingly
rare and valuable, and some of them are
mounted with silver bearing Elizabethan hall-marks.
They are disclaimed by continental authorities, who
refuse to acknowledge them as belonging to their
factories, and they apparently were made in England.
A great deal of mystery surrounds their origin, and
no doubt further research will at some future date
determine the history of these specimens which,
under various fancy names, such as "Tiger"
pattern, due to their peculiar mottling, bring considerable
prices under the hammer.</p>

<p>To bring the story of English delft to a conclusion,
it may be said that it had an ephemeral life as a ware
for domestic use, until it was dethroned by Staffordshire
salt glaze ware, which held the field until Wedgwood's
cream ware drove this latter from the market.</p>

<span class="f75">STONEWARE</span></p>

<p class="chapblock">Cologne Ware and Bellarmines&mdash;John Dwight of Fulham
(1638&ndash;1703)&mdash;The Brothers Elers, working in Staffordshire
(1690&ndash;1710)&mdash;John Astbury (1679&ndash;1743)&mdash;Thomas
Astbury&mdash;Fulham Stoneware&mdash;Nottingham Stoneware&mdash;Prices
of Stoneware.</p>


<p>Stoneware in point of date is prior to delft in its
beginnings, and it had in its subsequent development
a longer life than delft. It has already been
shown (Chapter II.) how broken is the history of the
evolution of the potter's art in England in the Middle
Ages. There are great gaps which divide the period
of the medi&aelig;val tiles from the more or less peasant
pottery known as slip ware. It is not until the
seventeenth century had well advanced that the
manufacture of stoneware took its place as an
industry.</p>

<p>To the beginner it should be explained that stoneware
is coated with a glaze by means of common
salt. It is extremely hard, and has a surface in
old and admired specimens like the skin of an
orange being pitted with minute depressions, or in
finer and thinner ware being like the surface of
leather or chicken skin. The ordinary ginger-beer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
bottle is stoneware, and although serving in a
humble capacity, is often found to be perfect in
the technique of salt glazing. In old jugs of seventeenth-century
manufacture, the mottled colouring
and distinctly pleasing surface varying in tone from
warm brown to reddish-yellow, is exceptionally
attractive to collectors who import a love for
technique into their hobby.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Bellarmine, or Greybeard, jug
was in use in this country for a considerable
period. References abound in old plays. Ben
Jonson, in his "Bartholomew Fair" (Act IV.),
makes Captain Whit say, "He has wrashled so long
with the bottle here, that the man with the beard
hash almosht streek up hish heelsh," in simulation of
the speech of a man who has well drunken. But it
must be concluded that this stoneware, or Cologne
ware, was largely imported, and was never greatly
made in this country until John Dwight, of
Fulham, took out his patent in 1671. There are
pieces bearing Elizabethan dates and coats of arms,
as, for instance, the small brown cruche in the
Schreiber Collection at the Victoria and Albert
Museum, with the initials "E. R." and the date
1594; and the fine Bellarmine jug in the British
Museum, with the arms of Queen Elizabeth, and
dated 1594. We illustrate a fine stoneware Bellarmine
jug, of the late sixteenth century, having a coat
of arms with crown and Tudor roses. The character
of some of these jugs differs from continental examples.
This may have been due to a desire on the
part of the consumer for vessels of that type, but
there seems some likelihood that the commoner sorts
were made here, and it is conjectured that Fulham
was the chief place of their manufacture.</p>

<p>In the group of fine Bellarmine jugs illustrated,
the characteristics of the ware are shown. The
decorations begin to assume a national feeling, and
the jugs differ in form from the continental type.
The fine specimen of grey stoneware with the portrait
medallion of Queen Mary is attributed to
Dwight. The inscription runs "Maria. D. G. Mag.
Brit. Franc, et. Hib. Regina." The right hand jug
in the group has a raised medallion portrait of
William III.</p>

<p>The Bellarmine, or Greybeard or Longbeard, is so
called from the head which appears on the neck of
the jug, which mask is always referred to in a satirical
manner as being the likeness of Cardinal Robert
Bellarmin, who rendered himself obnoxious by his
opposition to the reformed religion in the Low
Countries.</p>

These old examples of foreign stoneware, miscalled
<i>gr&egrave;s de Flandres</i>, are known to have been
made at Raren, at Siegburg, at Grenzhausen, near
Coblenz, and later in the seventeenth century they
were made at Namur.

<p>The fact that they were imported and not made
here appears from the petition of William Simpson,
merchant (<i>Lansdowne MSS.</i>) to Queen Elizabeth:
"Whereas one Garnet Tyne, a strainger living in
Acon, in the parte beyond the seas, being none of
her Majestie's subjects, doth buy up all the pottles
made at Culloin called Drinkynge Stonepottes &amp; he
onlie transporteth them into this realme of England
&amp; selleth them; It may please your Majestie to
graunt unto the sayd William Simpson full power
&amp; only license to provyde, transport, &amp; bring into
this realme, the same or such like Drynkynge pots";
the petitioner adds that "no Englishman doth transport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
any potte into this realme," he also gives a promise
"as in him lieth" to attempt to "drawe the
making of such like potte into some decayed town
within this realme, whereby many a hundred poore
men may be set a worke." Thirty years later Letters
Patent were granted to Thomas Rous and Abraham
Cullyn in 1626 for the sole making "of the stone
pottes, stone juggs, &amp; stone bottles, for the terme of
fourteene years for a reward for their invention."</p>

<p>Here, then, are sufficient facts to show how largely
the importation and manufacture was in foreign
hands, and the finer specimens must undoubtedly
be assigned to foreign potters.</p>

<p><b>John Dwight.</b>&mdash;In 1671 a patent was taken out by
John Dwight for "the mistery of transparent earthenware,
commonly knowne by the names of porcelaine
or China and Persian ware, as alsoe the misterie of
the stoneware vulgarly called Cologne ware." It
appears from this patent that he had "invented and
sett up at Fulham, several new manufactories."
There is no doubt that John Dwight was one of
the greatest, if not the greatest of English potters.
His magnificent life-size bust in stoneware of Prince
Rupert, now in the British Museum, excites the
wonder and admiration of modern potters. The
technical excellence he displays in his fine stoneware,
which is of a grey-white or pale fawn colour,
and is salt glazed, is as remarkable a triumph of
modelling as it is of skill in potting. To quote
Professor Church in regard to Dwight's busts and
figures, "They stand absolutely alone in English
ceramics. They are the original and serious work
of an accomplished modeller. The best of them
are instinct with individuality and strength, yet
reticent with the reticence of noble sculpture."</p>

<p>The illustration of the bust of <i>James II.</i> (<a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>)
is not so well known as the famous <i>Prince Rupert</i>,
nor is it of the same superlative power; but it is a
fine example of stoneware.</p>

<p>The two figures illustrated of <i>Children Reading</i>
have just been added to the national collection, and
exhibit the mastery of Dwight over his medium.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that John Dwight is coming
into his own. Among the fathers of English pottery
there are Dwight and Elers, and Astbury and
Whieldon, and Josiah Wedgwood, and the greatest
of these is unquestionably Dwight. Dr. Plot, in his
"History of Oxfordshire," published in 1677, passes
this eulogy upon him: "He has so advanced the
<i>Art Plastick</i>, that 'tis dubious whether any man
since Prometheus have excelled him, not excepting
the famous Damophilus and Gorgasus of Pliny."
And yet this Dwight is reported to have destroyed
most of his formul&aelig; and many of his papers connected
with his inventions in the hope that his
descendants would not engage in so unprofitable a
business.</p>

<p>It is not known when Dwight was born; 1638 is
the conjectured date. He was M.A. and B.C.L. of
Christ Church, Oxford, and was secretary to the
Bishop of Chester. Between 1671 and 1676 he
settled at Fulham. It appears that he had previously
established a factory at Oxford with considerable
success. He died in 1703, and the pottery
was continued by his son Samuel, who died in 1737.
The works were carried on by his widow, and subsequently
by William White, who married her, and the
pottery remained in the hands of the White family
until 1862.</p>

<p>Of his portrait busts and statuettes, the Victoria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and Albert Museum and the British Museum have
about thirteen examples, and there is a fine statuette
of <i>Jupiter</i> in the Liverpool Museum. Besides this
class of ware, he certainly made stoneware jugs of
the Cologne type, and red-ware teapots. He was
known to use small raised ornaments on this ware,
produced by the use of metal stamps. His vases
have marbled decorations, and he was fully aware
of the use of pounded flint, which gave his ware a
porcellanous character, "a discovery which was not
apparently known to the Staffordshire potters until
about 1720."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In relation to Dwight and his patents, new light
has been thrown upon the originality of the work of
the Brothers Elers in their secretly-guarded factory
at Bradwell Wood. All earnest students are indebted
to Professor Church for his recent researches
to establish Dwight's reputation, which go a great
way towards dethroning the two Dutch brothers
Elers, who have been hitherto regarded as the
pioneers of Staffordshire fine pottery.</p>

<p><b>Elers Ware (1690&ndash;1710).</b>&mdash;There is a great deal of
mystery surrounding the name and fame of the two
Dutchmen, John Philip Elers and David Elers.
They came to this country as did so many of their
countrymen in the latter part of the seventeenth
century. Earlier, Dutch refugees had fled hither
on account of religious persecution, and later, when
William of Orange came over, his court attracted
many of his countrymen of distinguished birth.
Martin Elers, the father of our two Dutchmen, had
been ambassador to several European courts. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Philip his son was "the godson of the Elector of
Mentz, after whom he was named, and was held at
the baptismal font by Queen Christina of Sweden."
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that they had any
patronage from the court themselves, but their sister
was granted a pension of &pound;300 a year by William,
and she subsequently became the second wife of Sir
William Phipps, founder of the house of Mulgrave,
the title of Earl of Mulgrave is now borne by the
Marquis of Normanby, whose family name is Phipps.</p>

<p>However aristocratic they were, it is certain that
they had considerable practical knowledge in order
to embark in business and carry on a pottery.</p>

<p>They prepared the red clay of Bradwell in a far
more scientific manner than had any Staffordshire
potters prior to that date, and by the lathe they turned
forms far thinner than could be done on the wheel.
Wherever they had gained their technical skill, they
placed for the first time the wares of Staffordshire on
the same plane as B&ouml;ttcher's work of Meissen, or the
models of the old Chinese potters.</p>

<p>We have already shown that they engaged some
of Dwight's workmen from Fulham, and that they
infringed Dwight's patents in respect to the Cologne
jugs and red teapots. This does not accord with the
fables hitherto industriously repeated in every succeeding
volume dealing with china, that the Elers
employed imbeciles in their factory, in order that
their trade secrets might be jealously guarded. It
is true that Twyford and John Astbury learned all
that they wanted to know by gaining employment at
the Elers pottery at Bradwell, and there is little
doubt that in so doing they simulated a stupid indifference
as to the new methods of stamping china<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
ornaments by metal stamps and of the lathe work
employed on the red teapots.</p>

<p>Both black and red teapots were made by Elers
and ornaments in Chinese style added in relief.
These ornaments were stamped with a metal die and
laid on the vessel, several dies were used for portions
of the same teapot. The connecting portions such
as the stalks between two sprigs were finished by
hand. This red ware was unglazed. As most people
are familiar with Wedgwood's black, basaltes ware,
it is useful to know that, except in colour, the wares
are almost identical in point of external appearance
and to the sense of touch. Some of this red tea and
coffee ware or "old china," as it was called, is marked
with a seal in imitation of Chinese marks. The red
teapots of small dimensions sold for ten to twenty-five
shillings apiece, and David Elers had a shop in
the Poultry in Cheapside, where he sold them.</p>

<p>The Elers left Staffordshire in 1710, so that their
pottery lasted only twenty years. In view of the fact
that Dwight complained about their manufacture of
stoneware jugs and mugs as being subsequent to his,
it would seem doubtful if they can still be accredited
with the invention of this old ware or with the introduction
of salt glaze into England. Undoubtedly
this early class of hard red stoneware, almost
approaching porcelain in character, will have to be
thoroughly reviewed with the object of assigning to
Dwight what is his, and to the Elers, and to Aaron,
Thomas, and Richard Wedgwood what is theirs, to
say nothing of Richard Garner, and of John Morley,
of Nottingham, who confessed to copying Dwight's
"browne muggs."</p>

<p>The subsequent history of the Elers may be interesting
in passing. John Philip is believed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
been in some way connected with the foreign glass
works at Chelsea, established by Italian workmen,
under the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham, as
early as 1676. He afterwards, with the assistance
of Lady Barrington, set up as a glass and china
merchant in Dublin, and became successful. David
Elers remained in London.</p>

<p><b>John Astbury.</b>&mdash;We have seen that the Elers' secret
became known in Staffordshire to Twyford, and to
John Astbury, and this latter together with his son
carried on the same style of manufacture. As a
general rule it is held that the ware of the earlier
Astbury is not so sharp in its details as was the careful
work of the Elers. His ware is of red, fawn,
chocolate, and orange colour. His ornaments
followed the style of Elers in being stamped, but he
made them of Devon or pipe-clay, which has a cruder
effect in white upon the darker grounds. He died in
1743. His son Thomas Astbury commenced potting
in 1723, and his work is so similar to that of his
father, that considerable doubt exists as to which
pieces may safely be attributed to the father. It is
certain that the son experimented with the bodies of
clays until he produced a "cream colour," afterwards
improved by Josiah Wedgwood in his renowned
cream ware. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_149">p. 149</a>) an Astbury
teapot in date about 1740, with an orange-coloured
glaze body having design in relief in white. The
other Astbury ware teapot is of slightly later date,
and has a coffee-brown body with white and green
floral ornaments in relief. The Porto Bello bowl in
the British Museum, of red clay with white stamped
ornaments in relief of a group of miniature ships
in battle array, made to celebrate the capture of
Porto Bello by Admiral Vernon in 1739, is held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to be a typical example of the work of the elder
Astbury.</p>

<p>As a rule, black or red specimens having the name
of Astbury impressed upon them are attributed to
Astbury the second. But it must be borne in mind
that for want of more exact knowledge, all red ware
with stamped ornaments applied in relief and with
indications of plain engine turning has been generically
termed <i>Elers ware</i>, and it is quite certain that
later than Astbury junior's day red ware with wavy
lines was made. Similarly the type of ware with white
applied ornament in relief has been termed <i>Astbury
ware</i>. The elder Astbury, in addition to the stoneware,
made crouch ware, a term employed for the
earlier forms of the fine delicate stoneware known as
salt glazed. The younger Astbury introduced the
use of flint into his ware in or about 1723. Collectors
should be cautioned not to assign plates and dishes
marked <span class="smcap">Astbury</span>, to Thomas Astbury. They are
cream ware, and decorated in blue with Chinese
patterns, and belong to a much later period.</p>

<p>Mention should be made of Ralph Shaw, of Burslem,
who made brown or chocolate ware dipped in white
pipe-clay, which afterwards was worked upon with a
tool to display the dark body beneath. There is a
jug in the British Museum (Franks Collection) which
is thus decorated with birds and foliage. Twyford,
the colleague of Astbury the elder, when with the
Elers, seems to have applied himself to the use of
white decoration, sometimes the red and brown ware
is wholly coated inside with pipe-clay, and this is
supposed to be his work.</p>

<p>With the advent of Josiah Wedgwood came the
strong classic influence upon his plastic art, and in his
various classes of stoneware (dealt with in Chap. VII.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
considerable variety was introduced both in design
and in colouring. Among the most notable of the
contemporaries and successors of Wedgwood who
successfully produced high-class stoneware, the
following may be mentioned: William Adams,
Turner, Elijah Mayer, Neale, Palmer, Birch, Keeling,
and Toft, Hollins, Wilson, Spode, Davenport, and
Dunderdale of Castleford, and the Leeds Pottery and
the Swansea Pottery both made basalt in black ware
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chap. VIII.</a>, The School of Wedgwood).</p>

<p><b>Fulham Stoneware.</b>&mdash;In the eighteenth century
Fulham became noticeable for a type of mug similar
to that illustrated (<a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>), bearing the initials "W.G."
and the date 1725. Another series made at Fulham
are the jugs usually marked with the initials "A.R."
and "G.R." belonging to the days of Anne and of
George I. A great many exist of the fuller-bodied
shape, with initials inscribed "G.R." Formerly on
museum shelves these were attributed to Fulham,
but it is now generally held that this form was
imported from the Continent, and belongs to the
<i>Gr&egrave;s-de-Flandres</i> class. The true Fulham contemporary
form is that which we illustrate (<a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>).</p>

The manufacture of stoneware continued for a
century, and in the nineteenth century many fine
specimens were being made by various potters, and
Messrs. Doulton, of Lambeth, still continue to make
stoneware vases and jugs and other vessels of an
ornamental character.

<p><b>Nottingham Stoneware.</b>&mdash;John Morley, of Nottingham,
was cited in 1693, as one of the persons who
infringed Dwight's patent for stoneware. Evidently
the same family of potters carried on the business,
for in 1726, Charles Morley was a maker of brown
stoneware jugs and mugs. There is a brown bowl at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the Victoria and Albert Museum bearing this date.
The Castle Museum at Nottingham possesses some
fine examples of brown stoneware. The dates of
jugs and mugs vary from as early as 1700 to the last
quarter of the eighteenth century. Nottingham ware
is smoother in its surface than old Staffordshire, only
slightly showing the orange skin texture so noticeable
in the other stoneware. It is rich warm brown,
sometimes inclining to red and sometimes to yellow
in colour. Bear jugs are a feature of Nottingham
stoneware, but they are not peculiar to that pottery,
as they were also made in Derbyshire and Staffordshire.
The Nottingham stoneware is excellently
potted and, of course, is salt glazed, the glaze
having a slightly lustrous appearance.</p>

<p>The examples most familiar to collectors belong
to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The bear jugs may be either of plain surface or may
have the rough grained exterior formed by minute
particles of clay. They frequently have a collar
around the neck, and a chain to which is attached
a rattle. A rarer form represents a Russian bear
hugging Bonaparte, who wears a big plumed hat.
Puzzle jugs with incised ornament, and tall loving-cups
of large size, are another noticeable production;
many of these are inscribed with names and dates.</p>

as a potter&mdash;Early Staffordshire Art&mdash;The
rivalry with salt glaze&mdash;Form
<i>versus</i> Colour&mdash;The last years of the Eighteenth
century&mdash;The English spirit&mdash;Prices.</p>


<p>"Early Staffordshire" is a generic term used to
include much of the unknown ware of the early period
between about 1720 to 1760. It is not early enough
to go back to the butter-pot days of Charles II. nor
to include the school of Toft and his contemporaries,
with their quaint native humour. But it is an important
period when earthenware was in a transitional
stage. It is, in fact, the period when Staffordshire
may be regarded as the great nursery of potters in
swaddling clothes who came into their majority later
with full honours.</p>

<p>The chronological table at the head of this chapter
shows the great events that were shaping the destiny
of this country, and, in politics, in art, and in letters,
it must be admitted that the age of Anne and the
first two Georges was prolific enough in incident. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was during the greater portion of the first half of
the eighteenth century that English earthenware
was finding itself. Attempts at classification nearly
always leave the borders overlapping. In trying to
gather in our net a band of representative potters
with work peculiarly illustrative of this period which
was essentially English&mdash;as English as Toft&mdash;but
progressing towards something that should stand as
worthy of our art, several great potters, such as the
Woods, have escaped, and will be treated separately
later. It must be granted that the influence of the
Whieldon school was not obliterated even by the
great rise of the classic school of design as exemplified
by Wedgwood, Turner, and Adams. The strong
English robustness and the national insularity of
design never wholly died out in the eighteenth
century. It was eclipsed by classic frigidities from
across the Alps, and it suffered discomfiture from the
rococo insipidities from France first naturalised at
Chelsea and at Derby. But it lingered in the hearts
of the common people like the tunes of some of the
old ballads in spite of the fashions of Gluck and
of Handel. Thus it comes to pass that, side by side
with the Iphigenias, the Andromaches, the Venuses,
the Minervas, and the other esoteric personages from
among the gods and goddesses of Olympus, with
their accompaniment of foreign fauns and satyrs,
there were the very English (founded on Gillray and
Rowlandson), almost Rabelaisian, grotesques in the
army of Toby Jugs and the sporting, rural, nautical,
historic, commemorative, and satiric jugs and mugs
and figures, with English doggerel and with idiosyncrasies
enough to make our earthenware essentially
national.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the early days it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
with any degree of certainty to assign many of these
older pieces to any particular potter. The collector
can only lament "the iniquity of oblivion blindly
scattering her poppy," as Sir Thomas Browne puts it.
It is without doubt rightly believed that Thomas
Whieldon had a great and lasting influence upon the
potters of his generation, but his own actual work
has been swallowed up by the covering phrase
"Whieldon ware," which, like "Elers ware" and
"Astbury ware," has come to mean a good many
things, and these are names of types rather than
persons.</p>

<p><b>The forerunners of Whieldon.</b>&mdash;It is necessary briefly
to recapitulate the events immediately from the commencement
of the eighteenth century to the day
when Whieldon established his status.</p>

<p>There was a continuous chain of potters working
in Staffordshire from the days of the Elers (1690&ndash;1710),
to the period when Josiah Wedgwood became
a master potter on his own account in 1760; he was
then thirty years of age.</p>

<p>Wedgwood's own estimate of the Elers is interesting.
Speaking of what Elers did for Staffordshire he
says, "It is now about eighty years since Mr. Elers
came amongst us ... the improvements made (by
him) in our manufactory were precisely these&mdash;glazing
our common clays with salt which produced
<i>Pot d'grey</i> or stoneware, and this after they had left
the country was improved into white stoneware by
using the pipe clay of this neighbourhood and mixing
it with flint stones calcin'd and reduced by pounding
in to a fine powder."</p>

<p>There is not a word about Dwight in all this;
evidently Josiah seems not to have known of the
legal action against Elers and one of his own kinsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
amongst others. The invention of flint is an
allusion to Thomas Astbury about 1720, but Dwight
also knew of this formula as his recorded notes prove.</p>

<p>To continue, "The next improvement by Mr. Elers
was the refining of our common red clay by sifting
and making it into tea and coffee ware in imitation
of the Chinese red porcelain by the casting it in
plaster moulds and turning it on the outside upon
Lathes, and ornamenting it with the tea branch in
relief, in imitation of the Chinese manner of ornamenting
the ware. For these improvements&mdash;and
very great ones they were&mdash;we are indebted to the
very ingenious Messrs. Elers, and I shall gladly contribute
all in my power to honour their memories and
transmit to posterity the knowledge of the obligations
we owe to them."</p>

<p>This is in respect to a jasper medallion portrait of
John Philip Elers. Wedgwood is wrong in one or
two particulars. The salt glaze question is open to
doubt, and most certainly Elers never used moulds
for their ware.</p>

<p>We give this as showing the continuity which
existed between Elers and Wedgwood, the latter
certainly owed his application of the ornamentation
in relief to the method which Elers had introduced
into Staffordshire. We do not say invented, because
there is always Dwight standing in the background.</p>

<p>To give Elers his due he certainly set Staffordshire
talking and wondering, and he unwittingly filled
Twyford and Astbury with new ideas which they
were not slow to adopt. Astbury comes as the echo
which Elers left behind in Staffordshire, a substantial
enough echo, for Astbury took his master's ideas and
created a ware with white stamped ornaments in
relief, to which his own name is given as a generic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
term. John Astbury the elder died in 1743, and
Thomas, his son, commenced potting as early as
1723. And the Astburys rub shoulders with Thomas
Whieldon, whose apprentice and sometime partner
(1752&ndash;1758) was Josiah Wedgwood.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Thomas Whieldon (1740&ndash;1780)
came upon the scene in the history of the
Staffordshire potteries when the art was in a somewhat
transitional stage. New fields were opening
and new ideas developing that were shortly to bring
English pottery into line with that on the Continent.</p>

<p><b>The position of Staffordshire Ware.</b>&mdash;It is necessary
to show the stage at which English pottery had
arrived in order to place Whieldon aright and to
show the various impulses which led to the outburst
of potting which stirred Staffordshire. Stoneware in
crude form or in highly finished foreign style in
Cologne ware had been gaining ground since Tudor
days. Later the use of delft had won favour and
was still in full swing at Lambeth, at Bristol, and at
Liverpool when Whieldon commenced potting. It
had also become acclimatised in Staffordshire. Toft's
and other slip ware was contemporary with delft as
a native art. And now, looking forward, we see the
oncoming triumph of stoneware, in its finely potted
and highly artistic Staffordshire form, which was to
overthrow delft and slip ware, and in turn be
stamped out by the utilitarian cream ware of Whieldon's
apprentice, Josiah Wedgwood, who built up his
fortune at Etruria on this domestic ware.</p>

<p>The Whieldon period (1740&ndash;1780) was an important
one in ceramic events. In 1744 Bow commenced
to make porcelain. In 1745 is the earliest dated piece
of Chelsea porcelain, the year that the Pretender won
the battle of Preston Pans, near Edinburgh, and invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
England, bringing his army as far as Derby.
In 1750, Derby made earthenware, and in 1751 commenced
to make porcelain, which is the same year in
which Worcester commenced a glorious record in the
making of porcelain. Longton Hall, Bristol, and
Liverpool continued the same story, and transfer-printing
was practised at Worcester by Hancock on
porcelain, and at Liverpool on delft tiles by Sadler
and Green. Lowestoft opened a kiln in 1756.
Leeds ware was made in 1760, and, finally, Wedgwood's
queen's ware in 1762, and four years before
Whieldon gave up his work Wedgwood had invented
his jasper ware.</p>

<p><b>Whieldon as a potter.</b>&mdash;Not a great deal is known of
Whieldon's personality. He must have commenced
in a small way of business as he tramped from place
to place with specimens of his wares on his back in
pedlar fashion. But he became of considerable importance
as he held the office of High Sheriff of
Staffordshire in 1786, some six years after he retired
from his pottery. Whieldon numbered among his
apprentices some young men who afterwards became
famous. There was Josiah Wedgwood, who
became his partner from 1753 to 1759, Josiah Spode,
and William Greatbach, Edge, Heath, Marsh, and
there was Aaron Wood, who was employed at Little
Fenton for some time. On account of his apprentices
having become famous, it has been suggested that he
was probably indebted to them for much of his fame.
On reflection it may possibly be seen that the opposite
conclusion may very well be true, and it is not
improbable that Wedgwood and Spode and Greatbach
and the others owed a considerable debt to
Whieldon for having received a highly technical
training at his hands.</p>

<p>In regard to cream ware, undoubtedly this was in
an experimental stage, and Whieldon in common
with Astbury made those queer little figures with
yellow heads and red or yellow bases, but the tortoiseshell
flown colouring apparently denotes some of the
specimens made by Whieldon. He made salt glaze,
he made tea and coffee pots with the Astbury decorations,
but with a strong leaning to the earlier Elers
style in his avoidance of too strong contrast between
white pipe-clay ornament on a dark body. Whieldon
toned his ornaments with touches of his own in green
and yellow and brown. His solid agate ware and his
tortoiseshell and clouded wares, and his cauliflower
ware have become so memorable in the cabinets of
collectors that they have won him fame, and he has in
consequence been credited with all specimens of these
classes of ware. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>) an example
of the Whieldon <i>Cauliflower Teapot</i> with vivid green
and yellow colouring.</p>

<p>Of this early period, the fine group we illustrate
(<a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>) with a <i>coffee-pot</i> of glazed red ware, a kaolin
of deep cream colour decorated in red, may not unreasonably
be attributed to John Astbury, while the
little <i>Figure</i> of flown colouring, with red base and
brown shoes, may be either by Whieldon or possibly
by Thomas Astbury.</p>

<p>The "solid agate" of Whieldon is something far
more artistic than the combed ware of earlier days
or the very rough attempts at solid agate made
by clumsier hands than his own prior to his
experiments.</p>

<p>Surface decoration in imitation of agate had been
produced by employing two different coloured clays
on the surface of a vessel, and when in a wet state
combing them to represent the desired veining of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
stone to be simulated. "Solid agate" is another
process of placing layers of clay of different colours
and cutting them in section to show the bands of
colour. In Whieldon's hands the layers were thin
and the waves and twists, cut off the clay with a wire
like cheese is cut, showed in the finished result something
more artistic than had ever been attempted
before. He made jugs and sauceboats, teapots, teapoys,
and other table utensils of this ware, including
knife handles. No two pieces are exactly alike, and
there is a considerable variety in the breadth of the
veining and in the ware, some being intentionally
coarser in order to suit the subject potted.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this ware, standing in a
measure in a <i>cul de sac</i> of ceramic art, is highly
effective, and Wedgwood used with great skill both
the solid agate and the surface colour for his ornamental
pieces and vases of classic type, in imitation
of granite, Egyptian pebble, jasper, porphyry, and
several kinds of agate. His range of colour was
more extended than that of Whieldon, but there is
little doubt that he gained his first knowledge of the
properties and possibilities of this variegated ware
when he was with Whieldon.</p>

<p>Casting about for something equally effective with
possibly less technical difficulties, Whieldon evolved
his celebrated clouded wares. Here he took advantage
of the new cream ware as a body, the surface
of which is splashed or sponged with various tints in
imitation of tortoiseshell, although many of the
colours introduced depart from tortoiseshell tones
and introduce something fresh and original in
earthenware decoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span></p>

<p>There is the patent taken out by Redrich and
Jones, Staffordshire potters in 1724, for "staining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
veining, spotting, clouding, or damasking earthenware,
to give it the appearance of various kinds of marble,
porphyry, and rich stones, as well as tortoiseshell."
And Ralph Wood, of Burslem, made variegated
ware of a particular kind which may well be termed
"tesselated," as small pieces of tinted clay were
affixed or inlaid on the surface of vessels to be
decorated, and subsequently glazed. This mosaic
work in imitation of granite was employed also at
Leeds.</p>

<p>To return to Whieldon. There is no doubt that
he found this variegated ware in a somewhat inchoate
state in regard to technique, and the more scientific
exactitude which he employed has gained for his
wares their fame. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a>) two fine
examples of tortoiseshell ware, a <i>Teapot</i> embossed
with hawthorn pattern design, and a finely decorated
<i>Bowl and Cover</i> having a running floral pattern in
relief.</p>

<p>The many coloured dessert plates, sometimes of
octagonal shape, made by Whieldon in this later
mottled manner, in which the surface only is
decorated, are well known to collectors. In Whieldon's
own examples the potting is more perfect
than in those of other potters. His plates are to
be recognised not only by their colour, but in the
very subtle way he has handled it. The deft touch
of blue or yellow or green, has in other hands
become a patch of obvious crudity, striking a discordant
note at once. The deep grey octagonal
plates by him are loved by connoisseurs as
exhibiting his subtlety at its best. We illustrate
two examples of this class of Whieldon tortoiseshell
plates with rich brown colouring flecked with green
and yellow (see <a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The mechanical mottling by his imitators, seemingly
dabbed on in spots by a sponge, should not
be easy to distinguish after having seen one of his
best examples. In regard to the potting, Whieldon
ware plates have a flat broad rim, which almost
invariably has a border of applied strips laid
crosswise.</p>

<p>But it must not be forgotten that, when once the
fashion for "Whieldon ware" became general, other
potteries came into line. At Liverpool this class of
mottled and clouded ware was made, and also at
the Castleford pottery, near Leeds, and consequently
many unmarked examples may be attributed to these
potteries. Some of the Castleford tortoiseshell plates
are impressed "D.D. &amp; Co."</p>

<p><b>Early Staffordshire Art.</b>&mdash;Among the earlier figures
of the Astbury pottery the elder Astbury worked
from 1736 to 1743, and his son continued his traditions
later. There are a number of quadrupeds and
birds which are assigned by collectors to the elder
Astbury, which are, although crude, extremely interesting
as showing the experiments in coloured
clays and in lead glazing. Agate figures of cats of
intermingled clays, and diminutive figures of men,
some six inches in height, with splashed or clouded
decoration, all come into this indeterminate period.
The figure in the group (<a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>) already referred to is
a case in point.</p>

<p>In the illustration of a fine specimen of an agate
cat, in height only 4 inches, the body colour is
light grey with dark brown solid marbling, and the
front and ears are splashed with blue. Another
miniature animal figure belonging to this period is
the salt-glaze jug in form of a bear, only 3&#8539; inches
high (see illustration, <a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>).</p>

<p>We illustrate two animals, one of the tortoiseshell
variety, a beast of formidable appearance and having
considerable power in the modelling and strongly
suggestive of the jaguar, but it must be remembered
that beasts as depicted in contemporary books have
an inclination towards heraldic monsters such as
"never were on land or sea." The splashed cream
ware elephant, only 3&frac34; inches in height, is fairly well
modelled. But these, in common with the many
diminutive figures of a like nature, belong to a period
when Staffordshire was endeavouring to found an
English school of potters, blindly groping along in
almost untutored fashion&mdash;lame in design and feeble
in inventiveness. From out of this chaos it seems
impossible that there should arise soul enough to set
the fashion later&mdash;nearly fifty years later&mdash;to the
continent of Europe, and make English earthenware
the formidable rival in point of cheapness, and often
in point of beauty, to anything produced on the
Continent. But the earthenware of Staffordshire
was able to teach new points in technique concerning
body and glaze to the continental potter.</p>

<p>In the illustration showing the group of <i>St. George
and the Dragon</i> it will be seen that the modelling
begins to assume a more pretentious character. The
prevailing colours of the knight are green and cream,
the horse and the base of the group are of the familiar
tortoiseshell colouring. Beside this St. George are
two early Staffordshire figures representing two old
women as hucksters. Here the feeling is instinctively
English, as national as are the Dutch beggars of the
seventeenth-century Dutch etchers. Pity it is that
this class of figure, recording national and local types,
did not develop on uninterrupted lines. It is true, and
of these we shall speak later, that the family of Wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in their types carried on the tradition, but the unfortunate
classic influence monopolised the talents
of the best modellers.</p>

<p>We illustrate two fine examples of <i>Toby Jugs</i>
belonging to the Whieldon period. There is a strong
family likeness between the two. The left-hand one
is richly glazed and mottled in tortoiseshell markings.
The other has the fine translucent colouring and
glazing so noticeably prominent in this school. They
are both remarkably good specimens of the Whieldon
manner, and of unusual interest, as they represent the
Toby jug in its earliest form.</p>

<p><b>The rivalry with Salt-glaze.</b>&mdash;This "Whieldon
ware" (of course it must not be forgotten that
Whieldon made salt-glaze too) was contemporaneous
with undecorated salt-glaze ware, which at
its best exhibited in no small degree a complete
knowledge of the strength and beauty of form unaided
by colour. But in this school of Whieldon
there is a distinct appeal to colour as a leading
feature of the ware as opposed to form. There is
a fine artistic blending of the colours and the variation
of the glazes which palpitate with life and give
extraordinary power to pieces possessed of the
"Whieldon" touch. Not only on flat surfaces such
as the well-known octagonal plates, but in figures
and groups such as we have illustrated, these colour
effects were employed with considerable dexterity.
So that, in the contemplation of black-and-white
illustrations of "Whieldon ware," everything is lost
which gave the beauty and richness and mellowness
which have an irresistible charm to those collectors
who confine themselves to this early school of
colourists.</p>

<p><b>Form <i>versus</i> Colour.</b>&mdash;The salt-glaze potters, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
they left their ideals of form and essayed to become
colourists as well, made this attempt chiefly for two
reasons.</p>

<p>(1) They had a very laudable desire to emulate the
coloured porcelain made at Worcester, Bow, Chelsea,
and Derby, which had become a serious competitor
in their markets.</p>

<p>(2) They recognised a certain weakness in their
ware in regard to its inapplicability to figures and
groups. Unless the modelling is of the highest
order the salt-glaze figures are insipid.</p>

<p>With regard to enamelled salt-glaze in general
this is dealt with in another chapter, but it may here
be remarked as touching the second point&mdash;the salt-glaze
figure&mdash;that the salt-glaze potter brought himself
directly in comparison with the figures and
groups of earthenware of the later Whieldon school.
Realising that if he must stand at all as a figure
potter his modelling must be superlative, we find the
salt-glaze figures, which are mainly small in size,
taken direct from the antique or from porcelain
models. But feeling the lack of colour he added
touches here and there by applying reliefs of different
coloured clays to heighten the effect. The salt-glaze
potter rarely enamelled his figures in colours. In the
illustration of a salt-glazed figure (<a href="#Page_351">p. 351</a>) there are
slight touches of blue.</p>

<p>So that in the contest between salt-glaze (the pre-eminent
art of the Staffordshire potter in early
eighteenth-century days) and its two great rivals,
English porcelain and Staffordshire coloured earthenware,
in other words&mdash;Form <i>versus</i> Colour&mdash;the first
fall it received was at the hands of "Whieldon
ware." The coloured and exquisitely clouded tortoiseshell
plate, with its fine gradations of tone throbbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with colour, more than holds its own with the salt-glaze
plate, even although its clear-cut arabesque
designs and intricate patterns exhibit the excellence
of its potting.</p>

<p><b>The Last Years of the Eighteenth Century.</b>&mdash;Enough
has been said to show that this typically English
school had firmly established itself in Staffordshire.
Whieldon, Dr. Thomas Wedgwood, Aaron Wood
(block cutter to Whieldon), Josiah Spode the first,
Greatbach, Enoch Booth, and many others, firmly
adhered to their love of colour and their desire to
see cream ware triumphant. The struggle for the
supremacy of earthenware over English porcelain
was still waging. And Wedgwood, with his marvellous
invention of jasper ware and his equally
stupendous innovation in the introduction of severe
classic ornament, did not impose his style on all
Staffordshire. We shall see in a later chapter how
he had a crowd of followers and imitators, but at the
same time many, very many, productions were potted
contemporary with him that owed nothing in design
to him, and on the face of them bear no traces of the
classic influence.</p>

<p>It is this overlapping period, during which so many
examples are unmarked, which is so puzzling to the
collector. "Old Staffordshire," they certainly are,
"Early Staffordshire" they may not be, but they
exhibit a national and original feeling which it is
impossible not to recognise and value.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span></p>

<p>We illustrate two groups of jugs which belong to
this period. In the top jug of the upper group,
which is pencilled with blue floral decoration, the
spout betrays a trace of Worcester and a tinge of
classicism in the acanthus leaf ornamentation at
its base. But the inscription drops at once into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
homely vernacular, "William and Mary Harrison
One Nother and Then." The quaint phonetic spelling
tells its own story of the mission of the ale-house jug,
with its invitation to another burst of hospitality.</p>

<p>The three jugs below are of the same species.
The handles vary slightly, showing the inclination
to adopt silver models. The left-hand one has a
panel with figure of Miser in relief each side. The
middle jug, with the heart-shaped panel, is decorated
in relief with group of Children at play. Such
subjects had not appeared on jugs before Wedgwood's
day, but the idea might easily have been derived
from contemporary prints of the pretty school of
Bartolozzi and Angelica Kauffman. The right-hand
jug, with its Peacocks in relief, is evidently derived
from the exotic birds of Worcester.</p>

<p>In the other group of jugs, the uppermost betrays in
the spout and neck distinct traces of its indebtedness
to classic forms. It is translucent green in colour,
and with coloured figures in high relief. At the
front is Shakespeare, with figures of <i>Miser</i> and
<i>Spendthrift</i> each side. Between these (one is just
visible in illustration) are classic medallions. This
is an incongruous style of decoration, and shows how
little the Staffordshire potter who made it understood
the meaning of ornament. He realised that
the classic style was becoming popular, and so he
half hesitatingly affixed two cameos to his otherwise
harmonious production. The granite-ware jug, finely
mottled, with two black-and-white bands as ornament
round body, is the newer development of the early
variegated ware. The right-hand jug is, in its
gnarled and bulgy protuberances, known as the
crabstock variety, the moulding, in the form of
satyr's head crowned with vines, is an addition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
is extraneous to the usual crabstock form. Obviously
this is a welding together of the English and classic
grotesque, and the combination is not too harmonious.</p>

<p>The early Staffordshire potters, apart from the
splashed and variegated ware associated with
Whieldon, made a variety of ware in pre-Wedgwood
days and in the late eighteenth century. Obviously
such a jug as that illustrated (<a href="#Page_189">p. 189</a>) is an Oriental
design taken straight from the contemporary English
porcelain, or even from the actual Chinese original.
But the Staffordshire potter was conservative in his
shapes. Similarly, such jugs as that illustrated
<a href="#Page_189">(p. 189</a>) with the rustic design in crude painting, or
seemingly in parts applied with a sponge, must have
been general in the latter half of the eighteenth
century. The scene is suggestive of Herrick and
maypoles and haywains and rustic junketings, and
such early cream-ware cider-mugs and ale-jugs are
not uncommon. The <i>Mug</i> (illustrated <a href="#Page_189">p. 189</a>) shows
distinctive qualities. It is by Enoch Wood. It is
decorated with translucent bands at top and base,
and ornamented with a diaper-pattern stamped and
coloured brown, with alternate lines of grey. These
jugs and mugs are here illustrated to impress upon
the reader the fact that in the Whieldon period
(1740&ndash;1780) other forms than variegated ware were
being made, and much unidentified early Staffordshire
ware belongs to the later years of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p><b>The English spirit.</b>&mdash;These forms&mdash;and the field
is a great one for detailed study&mdash;were growing up
in spite of foreign and un-English fashions, and long
after Wedgwood's day they existed. It seems as
though it was a dogged and obstinate attempt on
the part of the potter to ignore classic models, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
produce something "understanded of the people."
Obviously such ware did not rise to elaborate
ornamental vases, but confined itself to mugs and
jugs and useful articles in common use. So that, in
spite of the enormous influence of Wedgwood, both
in technique, but more especially in decoration, upon
his contemporaries and his successors, it would seem
that there was always an undercurrent of pottery
which, even if crude, was extremely national. It
appealed to no cosmopolitan <i>client&egrave;le</i>, and the
potters who made it were not important enough
to issue price lists in three or four languages. Their
message&mdash;as conveyed by their quaint inscriptions,
"One Nother and Then," "I drink to you with all
my hart, Mery met and mery part," and a host
of other na&iuml;ve sentiments&mdash;comes direct from the
heart of the potter to his friend and neighbour who
bought his wares. In a word, we may say that
much that is native, much that is racy of the soil,
in the long line of queer Staffordshire figures of
animals and birds and of homely individuals,
grotesque in their diminutive personality, owe direct
kinship to Whieldon and the pre-Wedgwood school
of potters, forgetful of the cold classic day, and, in the
words of William Blake, snug by the glad sunshine
of "the Alehouse so healthy and pleasant and warm."</p>

<span class="f75">SALT-GLAZED WARE&mdash;STAFFORDSHIRE</span></p>

<p class="chapblock">The originality of English Salt-glazed Ware&mdash;What is
Salt glaze?&mdash;Early Salt-glaze&mdash;The classes of Salt-glaze&mdash;Its
decadence and its extinction&mdash;Prices of
Salt-glazed Ware.</p>


<p>The fine salt-glazed stoneware of Staffordshire which
was made during the greater part of the eighteenth
century is something in art of which the English
potter may very justly be proud. It is remotely
derived from the fine Flemish and Rhenish decorated
stoneware, but the connection ends with the common
qualities of being glazed with salt and of being
extremely hard, almost so hard as to resist a file.
But in the Staffordshire salt-glazed ware the body
became almost of a porcelain-like quality. It was
able to be made as thin as stamped silver, and in the
thinnest portions of the pieces it is translucent like
porcelain. Indeed, since the days of Elers (whom
Dwight termed a silversmith) earthenware, or rather
stoneware, took some of its details in form and in
ornament from the worker in silver.</p>

<p>The applied ornament of Elers stamped with a
brass die suggests the metal worker, and, with the
models of the school of Astbury before them, Staffordshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
potters followed the same methods. It is not
astonishing to find the moulded designs with their
intricate patterns in the newer school of potters of
salt-glaze ware&mdash;which in its best period (1720&ndash;1740)
relied solely on form and not on colour, being a dull,
creamy white&mdash;emulating the fine work of the silversmith.
It was only a natural striving in the new
generation of potters of the Whieldon school, with
fresh inventions in clays and glazes and moulds, to
cast about them for better and worthier ideals than
Toft had, and fresher models than stoneware Bellarmines
which had been in circulation in the country
since Tudor days.</p>

<p>Silver models provided many a fine shape for
Wedgwood, his cream ware and his basalt teapots
are bodily taken from Sheffield. But imitativeness
has always been the curse of English potters.
Wedgwood copied in jasper ware the cameo work of
the classic world, and the whole of Staffordshire to a
man commenced to pot on similar lines. Through
the last decades of the eighteenth century, and well
into the nineteenth, thousands of vases and jugs were
turned out as echoes of Etruria in Staffordshire
which, as its name denotes, was but an echo of something
centuries earlier. Bow called itself "New
Canton," and Worcester slavishly copied Chinese
mandarins and exotic birds, coined in the brain of
some Oriental potter. Chelsea copied Dresden, and
Lowestoft copied the Bow and Worcester copies of
Chinese originals, and the list could be prolonged <i>ad
nauseam</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, this curse lies very heavy on the collector
who has to devote a great portion of his energy to
research in order to determine who first made certain
models. This, unfortunately, tends to divert the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
study of old earthenware, its artistic qualities and its
technical triumphs, into channels more or less
contentious. The literature of English ceramics is
rapidly becoming like many of the editions of
Shakespeare, where a few lines of text stand as an
oasis in a desert of commentators' controversial
opinions.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, refreshing to find, as one does
undoubtedly find in Staffordshire salt-glazed ware,
one of the most remarkable and original outbursts
in English art pottery that has taken place. This
delicate stoneware is as thin as some of the Oriental
porcelain, and possesses a grace and symmetry
peculiarly its own. In some of its decorations it
bears a likeness to Chinese work. This does not
detract from its high place as a ceramic record. On
the contrary, this similitude is a tribute to pay to its
artistic excellence, for there is very little earthenware
that came out of Staffordshire that will bear comparison
with the work of the Chinese potter.</p>

<p><b>What is Salt glaze?</b>&mdash;We know that many of the
stoneware Bellarmines and Rhenish jugs were glazed
with salt. It was a process known on the Continent
at a very early date, some authorities place it as
early as the twelfth century. But it was not until
the second half of the sixteenth century that German
and Flemish potters used this salt glaze to any great
extent. We have seen, in the chapter on stoneware,
that the appearance in the mottling and in the
orange-skin-like surface is due to the action of salt
glaze.</p>

<p>To cover pottery with an outer surface has been
practised from earliest times either by the use of
some glassy material or by powdered lead. Glazing
with common salt was quite a new departure by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
English potters. In order for this salt glaze to be
used there must be a very high temperature, so high,
as a matter of fact, that it would melt or soften in the
kiln most English earthenware. This is where stoneware
in its body differs from earthenware; it is what
is termed "refractory," that is to say, it is not readily
fusible. Stoneware is not always glazed. Elers did
not glaze his red ware, and Wedgwood did not glaze
his basalt or black ware. Stoneware can also be
glazed with other processes than the salt glaze,
but, as a rule, stoneware is associated with salt
glaze.</p>

<p>Without entering too tediously into the exact
steps by which salt glazing is performed, it may be
roughly described as follows. Other glazes, such as
lead, are applied to the surface of the ware prior
to its entry into the kiln for firing, but in salt glaze
the glaze is incorporated with the ware while it is
actually in the kiln. Towards the end of the firing
common salt (chloride of sodium) is thrown into the
kiln, which is packed with the ware, through apertures
in the kiln which has to be specially designed for
salt-glaze use. At the high temperature of the kiln
(about 2,190&deg; Fahr.) the salt is volatised and its
vapour penetrates the saggers (that is, the earthen
vessels containing the pieces being made), which have
perforated sides to enable this vapour to form on the
surface of the pieces being fired. This vapour
chemically unites with the silica largely present in
the body of the stoneware, and forms a silicate on
the surface of the ware. That is to say, the stoneware
becomes coated with a thin layer or glaze of
sodic silicate or soda-glass.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span></p>

<p>This chemical action taking place simultaneously
with the final firing of the ware before its removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
from the kiln incorporates the glaze with the body
of the ware itself. It is this combination which
causes the minute depressions or tiny pin-holes in
all stoneware from Bellarmines down to the finely
and nearly translucent salt-glazed Staffordshire
ware which has a surface like that of leather.
The same multitudinous pin-hole surface is characteristic
of Oriental porcelain, which like stoneware
is fired at a very high temperature, and the
glaze and the body completed at one firing in the
<i>grand feu</i>. Though, of course, this is not salt
glaze, nor is the surface other than as smooth
as glass to the touch, although under a strong
glass or even to the naked eye these pin-holes are
easily discernible.</p>

<p>At the present day salt glaze is mainly used
for such ware as ink-pots, drain pipes, insulators
for telegraphic instruments, and common ginger-beer
bottles. The connection between John Dwight,
of Christ Church, Oxford (Master of Arts), the
creator of the magnificent bust of <i>Prince Rupert</i>,
the glory of the ceramic collection at the British
Museum, and between John Philip Elers, godson
of Queen Christina, and this sad array of utilitarian
nondescripts, is not a pleasing subject for reflection.
It is sad to think that these triumphs have been won
in vain by the genius of the old potters over the
plastic clay. What an ignoble ending to the long
chain of experiments! When Dwight destroyed his
secret memoranda it is as though he foresaw the era
of the drainpipe.</p>

<p><b>Early Salt-glaze.</b>&mdash;The early stages of the manufacture
of salt-glazed ware were crude and experimental.
There is some connection between the finely
potted lustrous stoneware of Nottingham and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
"Crouch ware," the undeveloped form of the later
phase of finely-potted Staffordshire salt-glaze ware.
This "Crouch" ware represents the transitional
stage between the ordinary brown stoneware and
the later drab or greyish white examples. Crouch
ware at its earliest was not made in Staffordshire till
1690, and there is presumptive evidence to show
that salt-glaze brown ware was made at some pot-works
at Crich, near Matlock, Derbyshire; and that
the same or similar clay was used by the Staffordshire
potters who gave it that name, and there is
proof that the Crich pottery existed as early as 1717,
and Nottingham has dated pieces as early as 1700.</p>

<p>On the face of it, in spite of Josiah Wedgwood's
letter in connection with the medallion to John
Philip Elers, there is little evidence to go upon
to credit the Elers with having made salt-glaze ware
at all. Excavations on the site of their factory
at Bradwell Wood have only resulted in the discovery
of fragments of their unglazed red ware,
"red porcelain" as it was called, and experts have
pronounced their oven as being unfitted for salt-glaze
operations.</p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, in accordance with the
latest research, one is inclined to come to the conclusion
that the Brothers Elers did not invent Staffordshire
salt-glazed ware. If they made it at all, they
made very few examples. The red ware is theirs
as far as Staffordshire is concerned, although Dwight
had something to say on that score when he charged
them and Nottingham potters and others with
infringing his patents.</p>

<p>Among the early makers of salt-glazed ware were
Astbury and Twyford, and Thomas Astbury, son of
the former, being associated with the introduction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
ground flint into the body in 1720. Thomas Billing
in 1722, and Ralph Shaw in 1732, made further
improvements in the body. Dr. Thomas Wedgwood
and Aaron Wood, and Thomas Whieldon and Ralph
Daniel, of Cobridge, were all well-known makers of
this ware, the latter having introduced plaster-of-paris
moulds in lieu of alabaster, and being further
notable for his enamelled decorations in colour, in the
period 1743 to 1750, which attempted to vie with the
contemporary coloured porcelain. William Littler,
of Longton, used a similar blue to that which he used
on the porcelain at Longton Hall.</p>

<p>At this date the ware became white in colour, and
took its pleasing forms so dear to connoisseurs.</p>

<p><b>The Classes of Salt-glaze.</b>&mdash;In its various styles salt-glazed
ware may be roughly divided into periods.
The experimental stage was over in 1720. From
1720 to 1740 the undecorated or white examples were
made, depending on form for their beauty. These
had applied ornamentation stamped with metal
dies, or made in separate moulds and affixed to the
body to be decorated (similar to the Elers style). It
is during this period that some of the finest pieces
were made with sharp, clear-cut designs. Later,
when moulds were made of plaster-of-paris in place
of alabaster, the design became blurred.</p>

<p>Among the most beautiful designs in this plain
white ware having raised ornament are sauceboats,
pickle trays, sweetmeat dishes, teapoys or tea canisters,
and teapots; these latter are of a great variety of
shapes, many having shell ornament, very exquisitely
moulded, and others being of hexagonal shape
divided into compartments. There is, too, a trace
of the grotesque discernible in some of these teapots
and a subtle humour too rarely found in English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
pottery. There are those of the camel form, such as
the specimen illustrated (<a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>). The peculiar handle
made by hand is very noticeable, usually such handles
are snipped off at the end. Others are of the shape
of a house, and many types of this design occur.
Some are in the form of a squirrel. Then there are
the heart-shaped teapots with the spout incongruously
representing an arm resting on the neck of a
swan. These teapots were supposed to have been
made for lovers. We give an illustration (<a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>) of
one of these heart teapots, and it will be seen how
a slight touch of gilding has been added to heighten
the effect on the embossed portions showing the fruit.
Of course the cauliflower teapot exhibits a touch
of humour, too, but this form is rarely found in
salt glaze. The bright natural colours of that interesting
vegetable were reproduced by Whieldon,
who made this type as well as melon and pineapple
teapots and coffee-pots. The vivid green and
yellow glaze of this cauliflower ware is of the period
when Josiah Wedgwood was with Whieldon and is
held to be young Josiah's invention. He afterwards
made similar ware himself.</p>

<p>The next stage was the slight use of colour in
what is termed "scratched" blue. This style of decoration
is the opposite of the relief ornaments. The
pattern was incised with a sharp instrument on the
piece, in the lines thus cut cobalt blue was applied
with a sponge. Birds and foliage are the typical
form of decorations to pieces of this style from 1740
to about 1750.</p>

<p>From 1745 to 1750 William Littler introduced his
cobalt blue ware over which decorations in black or
white were enamelled or gilded, and such pieces are
rare. (See illustration <a href="#Page_201">p. 201.</a>)</p>

<p>Then comes the period in which colour was in full
swing. From 1740 to 1760 enamelling in colours
was extensively used. It was employed on plain
surfaces, or as a touch of colour to ornaments in
relief. There is no doubt that some of these coloured
examples are very beautiful. It is not necessary to
dethrone the plain white ware from its place of
honour. With later developments it was found that
colour could be used with artistic advantage, nor is
there any deterioration of the ware from an &aelig;sthetic
point of view in this colour work when in the hands
of skilled craftsmen.</p>

<p>Similarly transfer-printing was recognised as a
suitable means of decoration, and pieces are found
with printed designs of black or red or puce. The
head of the King of Prussia is found on some specimens
of this type. Of course this is later in date,
and must have been subsequent to 1760, when
Sadler and Green invented transfer-printing at
Liverpool. Doubtless these pieces entered into
competition with the new colour ware then in
vogue, which drove the salt-glaze ware from the
market, and killed the most artistic and original
productions the English potter had ever made.</p>

<p>The industry had by this time grown to great
dimensions, and apparently the Staffordshire potters
were turning out this salt-glazed ware as fast as they
could, no very good sign that good work was to last
much longer. Nor is all the enamel work English;
two Dutchmen were secretly employed at Burslem to
do this enamelling in colour. But the secret spread,
and we find two Leeds painters, Robinson and
Rhodes, doing enamelling on the salt-glazed ware for
the Staffordshire potters.</p>

<p>We are enabled to reproduce a very fine example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of enamelled salt-glaze ware having the inscription
"James and Martha Jinkcuson," and dated 1764. It
stands as a fine specimen of its class. The colours
of the flowers and insects are very rich, being, as is
usual, enamelled over the salt-glaze ground. Dated
salt-glazed ware is always uncommon, and an
example of such fine colouring in such perfect
condition stands as a rare and splendid specimen.</p>

<p>There is yet another style in salt-glaze in which
the whole surface of the piece to be decorated is
coated with a slip of another colour, and the decoration
cut through it to show the white body beneath.
This belongs to the last period, 1760 to 1780, as also
does the basket work for which Aaron Wood, and
R. J. Baddeley, of Shelton, are noted for their fine
patterns. Incised work in imitation of Japanese
work was also prevalent during the last period of
salt-glaze work.</p>

<p>We illustrate another very important salt-glazed
piece, a teapot enamelled in colours having what is
known as a "crabstock" handle, spout, and lid. It
is remarkable as being incised with the name "John
Toft" (see <a href="#Page_205">p. 205</a>). Undoubtedly this is a member
of the celebrated Toft family, whose dishes, marked
"Ralph Toft" and "Thomas Toft" in slip-ware,
gave the generic name to a class of ware. It is
not improbable that one of the Tofts modelled the
celebrated salt-glaze "pew group" in the Victoria and
Albert Museum. It exhibits the peculiarly quaint doll-like
faces with beady eyes associated with Toft dishes.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span></p>

<p>In the group illustrated (<a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>) there is one
enamelled jug. The two dishes show another type
of plain salt-glaze. The teapot shows incised work
on the broad band around it, but no indication of
colour. The coffee-pot is the well-known squirrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
form, and the dark teapot on left is enamelled in
blue by Thomas Littler, and is a rare example.</p>

<p>In colouring the salt-glazed vase in bright turquoise
blue and pink and green, with its Oriental design,
strongly suggests the enamel work of Limoges (see
<a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>). It stands in the eighteenth century in the
same relationship to the metal enameller as does a
modern French factory at Bordeaux, Messrs. Viellard
&amp; Cie., whose work in coarse earthenware simulates
the <i>cloisonn&eacute;</i> enamel.</p>

<p>The punch bowl illustrated has a portrait of the
Young Pretender. In date it is, of course, not
earlier than 1745, the year of the Rebellion in Scotland
on behalf of the Pretender, and when his son
Charles Edward landed and defeated the royal forces
near Edinburgh. This punch bowl tells its story of
stirring days, when Jacobites secretly met at night in
quiet manor houses and drank a toast to the Stuart
claimant. In public by a kind of subtle jest when
they were driven to drink the health of "the king,"
they by a specious mental reservation flourished their
glasses over any water on the table, the hidden meaning
being "the King&mdash;over the water." But here is
a punch bowl which was probably brought out for the
sworn partisans to drink to the pious memory of
the exiled Stuarts. There was always, even when
the Stuart cause was a lost one, a tender recollection
of "Prince Charlie," the "Young Chevalier." The
lilting lines of Bobbie Burns in the last quarter of
the eighteenth century, always awaken romantic
associations, and bowls such as this were relics of
something that had been, and without doubt in its
day this same bowl has filled the glasses of a loyal
company who drank the health of his Gracious
Majesty George the Third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>As we have pointed out in the introductory note
there are many monuments in clay on the collector's
shelf which punctuate the sonorous phrases of the
historian. Such pieces are exceptionally interesting
in aiding the reflective mind to recreate the events
of a former day which touched the life roots of the
nation.</p>

business abilities&mdash;Josiah Wedgwood's wares&mdash;Cream
Ware and its invention&mdash;Jasper Ware and
its imitation&mdash;The influence of Josiah Wedgwood&mdash;Wedgwood
Marks&mdash;The Prices of Wedgwood.</p>


<p>The time is now ripe to form a mature judgment as
to the exact niche in the temple of fame which
Josiah Wedgwood is to occupy permanently. His
immediate successors were in too close proximity to
his own day to form an opinion as to his life-work
in relation to what had gone before and what has
succeeded him.</p>

<p>The inquiry into the origins of certain inventions
attributed to him have been pursued of late years
with a scientific thoroughness, and many facts have
come to light which tend to raise the reputation
of other lesser known potters who immediately
preceded him or were his contemporaries.</p>

<p>John Dwight (of Fulham) has come into his own.
The Elers (of Staffordshire) have been dethroned
from the unique position they occupied as pioneers
of salt-glaze ware. In regard to the Astburys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
father and son, credit has been given them for
great work, and Whieldon is held to have had an
immense influence on his contemporaries. During
the great outburst in salt-glazed ware, cream ware, its
later rival and conqueror, was in a transitional stage.
This transitional period embraces a great field of
pioneer workers who experimented unceasingly with
clays and glazes. The days of salt-glaze were
drawing to a close, it had many obvious defects; the
ware would not readily stand hot liquids&mdash;and this
in an age when tea drinking was becoming fashionable.
The artistic side for the moment was cast
aside in these experiments, the uppermost question
in the Staffordshire potters' minds was the invention
of some ware that could hold its own against the competition
of the new English porcelain factories.</p>

<p>It thus came about that this period of great
technical activity (1720&ndash;1740) was immediately
succeeded by an almost simultaneous exhibition of
work, suggesting a renaissance of earthenware in
England (1740&ndash;1800) and establishing the European
reputation of Staffordshire.</p>

<p>Josiah Wedgwood with John Turner, of Lane End,
and William Adams, of Greengates, stand as a trio of
master potters who developed the classic spirit in
jasper and kindred ornamental ware. In regard to
developing the manufacture of cream ware and stone
ware for domestic use, and in building up a continental
and American trade which won for British
earthenware the supremacy of the world's trade in
pottery, Josiah Wedgwood takes an equal prominence
together with Warburton and the Baddeleys and the
Adamses and Turner.</p>

<p>In roughly detailing the stages which led up to
the manufacture of the main classes of ware for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
which Wedgwood was famous, it will be shown how
with a masterly mind for realising broad results he
combined the patient industry of a practical potter.
He commenced with a capital of twenty pounds and
died worth half a million. In spite of his ill-health
and the loss of his leg, his unflagging energy and
his keen foresight enabled him to build up an
important business which is still carried on by his
descendants. His love of organisation and the
system of control which he exercised over his own
enormous output had a lasting effect on the methods
of the Staffordshire potteries.</p>

<p>The genius of Josiah Wedgwood has won the
continued admiration of succeeding generations. It
may be that he has somewhat overshadowed many
of his contemporaries, and his successors have been
termed imitators. In order to adjust matters there
is a tendency in some quarters to belittle the work
of the great Josiah. But surely the pendulum has
swung too far the other way when it is advanced that
"Wedgwood himself was no artist, he was a tradesman
pure and simple."</p>

<p>This is not the opinion of critics with nicer
balanced judgment and of cosmopolitan taste. The
epitaph upon his monument in the parish church of
Stoke-upon-Trent, which bears the inscription that
he "converted a rude and inconsiderable Manufactory
into an elegant Art," has been assailed in order to
prove it to be a "travesty of the fact," and to state
that "what he <i>really</i> did was to convert an Art&mdash;rude
it may be, and inconsiderable, but still an Art&mdash;into
a manufacture. In other words, he inaugurated an
entirely new order of things in the production of
pottery, and a less desirable one."</p>

<p>The truth is that it is not necessary to belittle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Wedgwood in order to put his great contemporaries
in the order of their merit. The later and more
corrected opinion may be arrived at quite judicially
by crediting them with some of the artistic impulses
he possessed. While he lived he worked harmoniously
and in close friendship with his fellow potters, and a
century after his death it should not be difficult to
determine their relative positions without bespattering
his epitaph with mud.</p>

<p><b>Wedgwood's business abilities.</b>&mdash;He was undoubtedly
a keen man of affairs. When in partnership with
Whieldon he had travelled to London, to Manchester,
to Birmingham, to Sheffield, and to Liverpool, which
brought him into touch with silversmiths and metal workers
in connection with the agate knife-handles
and similar Whieldon ware. He evidently realised
that Staffordshire was behind other districts in many
respects. Although only a young man, he interested
the influential people in the neighbourhood of the
potteries and the roads were improved and water
transit provided as an outlet for goods. He cut the
first sod of the Trent and Mersey Canal.</p>

<p>In 1759 he was master potter, but he made most
of his own models, prepared his own mixtures,
superintended firing, and was his own clerk and
warehouseman. Less than ten years afterwards,
on the advice of the Duke of Marlborough, Lord
Gower, and Lord Spencer, he opened showrooms in
London in Newport Street.</p>

<p>A year after this the demand for his fine jasper
ware and expensive ornamental productions had so
increased that he found the greatest difficulty in
finding sufficient workmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span></p>

<p>His catalogues were printed in several languages,
and he had the shrewd common sense to add some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
forewords of his own to indicate the lines on which
he was working as a potter and to bring the attention
of likely buyers to his ware.</p>

<p><b>Wedgwood as a potter.</b>&mdash;There is no doubt that
Wedgwood always had in view the improvement
of whatever ware he engaged to make. When with
Whieldon he perfected the green glaze in the cauliflower
and kindred ware, and when he became a
master potter in 1759, he produced pieces which were
eminently remarkable for their fine technique. There
is no doubt that his connection with silversmiths
induced him to follow their designs. Some of his
early ware, such as teapots, have punched perforated
ornament in the rims for which he invented tools.
In the museum at Etruria are some six thousand
trial pieces, some few inches in length, covering a
wide period when Josiah was pursuing his way
towards his crowning achievement, the invention of
his jasper ware.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>He claims credit for great improvements, both as
an inventor and as a ready and masterly adapter,
quick to seize the salient points of a half-perfected
ware and by a few touches of genius make it his own.
He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society for his
invention of a pyrometer, an instrument for registering
high temperatures in the kilns. His experiments led
him into new fields in connection with bodies, glazes,
and colours, and he introduced for the first time in
pottery certain minerals such as barytes in his pastes.</p>

<p><b>Josiah Wedgwood's wares.</b>&mdash;It will be seen, in the
enumeration of the various classes of ware which
were produced by him, in what respect he added
improvements which in their turn were improved upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
by later potters, and to what extent his productions
were entirely original, adding a new note in English
pottery, creating an entire school, and leaving the mark
of his genius on his successors for nearly a century.</p>

<p><i>Variegated ware.</i>&mdash;The agate, the cauliflower, and
melon ware, the clouded and mottled glaze, and the
various imitations of marbling, came into vogue in
the days of Whieldon. But Wedgwood was more
ambitious in his designs. We have already seen, in
dealing with Whieldon ware, how the "solid" agate
ware was produced by means of fine layers of clays
of different colours, which after careful manipulation
produced a series of waves resembling the natural
ornamentation of the stone. Wedgwood also employed
"surface" colouring for this variegated ware, the body
being of the common cream-coloured earthenware
and the veining and mottling being applied to the
surface. In such pieces the handles and the plinths
were usually oil gilded; later he used a white semi-porcelain
for plinths of such ware.</p>

<p>Two agate vases and ewers marked "Wedgwood
and Bentley" belong to the period 1768 to 1780.
The plinths of the agate vases show the white
undecorated body. Wedgwood imitated Egyptian
pebble, jasper, porphyry, and various kinds of granite
speckled with grey, black, white, or green. Much
of this is a flight higher than the agate ware.</p>

<p><i>Black basalt Ware.</i>&mdash;In this ware, which was
termed "Egyptian black," Wedgwood triumphed
over his predecessors. We know the black ware
made by Elers and by Twyford (two fine black
Twyford teapots are in the Hanley Museum), but
the ware into which Wedgwood infused his genius
is worthy to be called what he termed it&mdash;"black
porcelaine." With its rich black, smooth surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
it was capable of varied use, including useful as
well as ornamental ware. In the former, we find
tea services and coffee or chocolate pots strictly
adopting the severe Queen Anne silver shapes, and
in vases he followed bronze prototypes. See illustration
(<a href="#Page_241">p. 241</a>) of two <i>Black basalt Teapots</i>. It was
used in fine manner for life-size busts and for
medallion portraits of "illustrious Ancients and
Moderns."</p>

<p>This basalt ware Wedgwood further used in
combination with other processes. He imitated
the ancient Greek vase paintings by decorating the
black surface with unglazed colours, or he had
ornaments in relief in red. Another replica of
classic art was his simulation of bronze, and this
black ware formed the groundwork to which he
added the bronze metallic colouring in his rare
bronze examples.</p>

<p>The two black basalt ewers, entitled <i>Wine</i> and
<i>Water</i>, designed by Flaxman, are well known. It
is at once evident that they owe no inconsiderable
debt to the metal worker. It requires no great
stretch of imagination to believe them to be in
bronze. Technically, as specimens of earthenware,
they are perfect, but it is open to question whether
the potter has not trespassed on the domain of the
worker in metal. There are canons which govern
the art of pottery; form and ornamentation strictly
appropriate in metal are utterly unfitted for the
worker in clay. Branched candelabra are false in
porcelain though extremely beautiful in silver. In
passing this criticism, which applies to some of
Wedgwood's work, we are incidentally brushing
aside the contention of those critics who find him
unoriginal. As a matter of fact he was so original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and so responsive to the suggestion of allied arts
that he often undertook the creation of pieces in
his kilns the like of which no potter had ever
attempted before.</p>

<p><i>Red Ware.</i>&mdash;It is not to be supposed that Wedgwood
would allow the fine red Elers ware to stand as
representative of the uttermost that Staffordshire had
produced without attempting to emulate this early
ware. Accordingly, we find in what he terms his
<i>rosso antico</i>, a red ware of extraordinary beauty.
Some of the engine-turned pieces of this red ware
are exceptionally fine. There is in the Hanley
Museum a coffee-pot of great technical and &aelig;sthetic
value. Wine-coolers and other useful creations, with
classic ornamentation in relief, show the wide
range of this red terra-cotta or unglazed ware.
The Elers style was simple, with applied stamped
ornament of small dimensions and Oriental rather
than classical in <i>motif</i>. The red stoneware of
B&ouml;ttcher, of Dresden, was by this time fairly well
known, and Wedgwood had both Elers and B&ouml;ttcher
to serve as models, although he does not seem to
have employed this red ware to any great extent.
Nor did Wedgwood confine himself to red in this
type of ware; he made chocolate-coloured examples,
and in his cane-coloured and bamboo ware he made
articles for domestic use, such as tea and coffee
services as well as mugs and jugs of this type, which
differed from the black basalt inasmuch as the basalt
was an especially hard body, whereas these others
were porous and soft. As was usual with Wedgwood,
not only did he have a series of wares of
different colours, but he often worked with a combination
of these colours in the same piece.</p>

<p><b>Cream Ware.</b>&mdash;Something must be said concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the development of cream ware before it can be
accurately determined how much Staffordshire was
indebted to Wedgwood for its development. At
the outset it must be granted that he did not
invent the ware. But he improved it. Similarly
it was further improved subsequent to his day by
other potters who made it finer and whiter.</p>

<p>But to this day, a hundred and fifty years after
the introduction of this cream ware, his descendants,
still trading under the name of Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood
and Sons, produce this cream ware exactly
as it was then produced. Dinner services are made
with Flaxman's designs on the border, essentially
English in character and feeling. Last year Messrs.
James Powell and Sons, of the Whitefriars Glass
Works, near the Temple, which were flourishing in
1710, and still continue to produce the finest glass
in England, held an exhibition of Wedgwood ware.
Considerable interest was drawn to the subject of
this revival of the old patterns of 1775 from the
designs of Josiah Wedgwood's band of artists.
Those connoisseurs who love old furniture and old
eighteenth-century glass ware, as made by Messrs.
Powell, welcomed the Wedgwood queen's ware
designs as being something eminently fitted to
strike the right note of harmony, and accordingly,
by arrangement with the firm at Etruria, some of the
finest patterns of the old ware are exclusively made
for Messrs. Powell. The English dinner table may
now be as English as it was in Georgian days, and,
happily, this &aelig;sthetic revival has met with a warm
response by the patronage of the royal family, the
nobility, and by all those who love the old-world
charm of the domestic art of our forefathers.</p>

<p>Before Wedgwood's day cream ware was made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Astbury used an addition of white clay and flint
to his bodies about 1720. In 1726 the grinding of
flint stones into powder for the potters' use became
so important that Thomas Benson took out a patent
for a machine to do this. In 1750 we find cream
ware being largely made. Aaron Wedgwood and
William Littler introduced about this time a fluid
lead glaze instead of the old manner of using
powdered galena (native sulphide of lead). Body
and glaze were at this period fired at one operation.
Enoch Booth improved this by revolutionising the
method of glazing. He fired the pieces to a biscuit
state and then dipped them in this fluid lead glaze
(ground flint and white lead), and refired them at
a lower temperature. At this date two other potters,
Warburton (of Hot Lane) and Baddeley (of Shelton),
followed Booth's practice, and cream ware may be
said to have been in a fairly flourishing condition.</p>

<p>These facts are all important and cannot be ignored
in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion. Wedgwood
commenced as a master potter in 1759, that is, about
nine years after the latest inventions in cream ware
had brought the ware into something more than
an experimental stage. In 1761 Wedgwood's cream
ware, both by its variety of beautiful form and its
finer glaze and body, had surpassed that of his rival
potters.</p>

<p>In 1762 Wedgwood presented to Queen Charlotte
a caudle and breakfast service of the ware; this was
painted by Thomas Daniel and David Steele. The
Queen and the King were so pleased with the ware
that complete table services were ordered, and
Wedgwood received the Queen's command to call
himself "Potter to Her Majesty" in 1765, and from
that date he termed the ware "Queen's Ware."</p>

<p>Though the invention of cream ware may not
be his, there must have been something essentially
more pleasing in his productions to have made such
strides in so short a time. Perhaps Wedgwood, "the
tradesman pure and simple," had something to do
with this achievement, but we prefer to think it
was the master hand of Wedgwood the potter and
Wedgwood the artist.</p>

<p>We cannot leave this <i>cream ware</i> question without
referring to an old legal controversy. This brings us
down to the year 1775 when Wedgwood, in company
with John Turner (of Lane End) journeyed to Cornwall
and jointly leased some clay mines. The reason
for their visit was that the whole of the Staffordshire
potters were up in arms. Salt glaze was coming to
an end in spite of the enamelling in colours in emulation
of English porcelain. And now Cookworthy, the
potter of Plymouth, the maker of the first hard
porcelain in England, had sold his patent rights
to Champion of Bristol, who, in 1775, applied for a
further patent for fourteen years to use certain
natural materials for making porcelain. The
Staffordshire potters elected Josiah Wedgwood and
John Turner as their representatives and petitioned
against the granting of this patent, and Wedgwood
urged that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"the manufacture of earthenware in Staffordshire has of late received
many essential improvements, and is continually advancing to higher
degrees of perfection; that the further improvement of the manufactory
must depend upon the application and the <i>free use</i> of the various raw
materials that are the natural products of this country."</p></blockquote>

<p>He further adds that "the natural productions of
the soil ought to be the right of all."</p>

<p>Incidentally, this controversy throws light on the
position of Wedgwood as a maker of cream ware,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and it had a lasting effect, as we shall show in the
improvement of cream ware itself and upon the
class of ware turned out in Staffordshire.</p>

<p>Champion, in his reply to the Staffordshire outburst
in petitioning parliament not to grant his
patent, pays Wedgwood a great compliment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Champion most cheerfully joins in the general praise which is
given to Mr. Wedgwood for the <i>many improvements which he has
made in the Staffordshire earthenware</i>, and the great pains and assiduity
with which he has pursued them. He richly deserves the large fortune
he has made from these improvements."</p></blockquote>

<p>Champion goes on to make a most vital point in
upholding his claim to protection that he</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"has no objection to the use which the potters of Staffordshire may
make of his or any other raw materials <i>provided earthenware only,
as distinguished by that title, is made from it</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then, is the reason of the visit of Wedgwood
and Turner to the West, in search of the natural earths
that half the potters in Europe had been hunting for
since B&ouml;ttcher, of Dresden, made his great discovery
of white clay.</p>

<p>But the story of <i>cream ware</i> is not ended. Wedgwood
to this printed "Reply" by Champion entered
the lists with some printed "Remarks," which he
circulated to members of parliament. In this&mdash;and
we must bear in mind that he was holding a brief on
behalf of all the Staffordshire potters&mdash;we find the
following statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>When Mr. Wedgwood discovered the art of making Queen's Ware</i>,
which employs ten times more people than all the china works in the
kingdom, he did not ask for a patent for this important discovery. A
patent would greatly have limited its public utility. Instead of one
hundred manufactories of Queen's Ware there would have been one;
and instead of an exportation to all quarters of the world, a few pretty
things would have been made for the amusement of the people of fashion
in England."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the opposition of Staffordshire, the Bill
enabling Champion to obtain his patent rights passed
both houses of parliament, and in the last stage a
clause was inserted throwing open the free use of
raw materials to potters for any purpose <i>except for the
manufacture of porcelain</i>; practically this patent was
to be enjoyed by Champion for nearly twenty-two
years.</p>

<p>Two extraordinarily important effects upon the
pottery industry in Staffordshire were the result of
this controversy: (1) The Staffordshire potter confined
himself to earthenware. (2) Growan stone
and Cornish Kaolin were added to the cream ware
body, which enabled earthenware to compete successfully
with china.</p>

<p>It may have struck an inquiring spirit as singular
that the Staffordshire potters as a body were content
to imitate English porcelain and compete with it.
At first, of course, the remoteness of the Potteries
from the West accounted for this, but clay was
brought by sea from Bideford to Chester and carried
overland to Staffordshire, but not the growan stone
nor Cornish kaolin. Chelsea and Bow did not have
natural earths to hand. But the additional reason
seems to be the one we have given&mdash;that practically
Champion's patent precluded them from making
porcelain. When, in or about 1769, cream ware
was perfected there was no need to cast about for
new bodies. Staffordshire earthenware had found
itself, and all other improvements after that date,
for fifty years, until early nineteenth-century days,
mainly concerned enamelling, printing, glazing, and
the <i>exterior</i>, or developments in mechanical production,
or attempts at higher artistic effects.</p>

<p>In the illustrations we give of cream ware it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
be seen that it was of varying form and it received a
variety of decoration.</p>

<p>It was <i>plain or undecorated</i>, relying chiefly on its
symmetry of form as an artistic asset. The cut and
pierced designs and many other shapes followed
those of the silversmith, and in dessert dishes and
centre-pieces considerable beauty was exhibited in
modelling&mdash;a style which was closely followed by
the Leeds potters, who made excellent cream ware.</p>

<p>A beautiful example of the perforated basket ware
is illustrated (<a href="#Page_225">p. 225</a>). It is a dessert dish of most
pleasing shape, and is a rare specimen of the pierced
work in Wedgwood's cream ware.</p>

<p>Wedgwood, as early as 1775, still experimenting
with a view to make his cream ware better, determined
to make a whiter body by the addition of
more china clay and flint and to kill the yellow tone
by the use of blue (oxide of cobalt). This later
white ware he termed "Pearl ware." Among the
most noticeable productions in this whiter ware are
the dessert services modelled from shells. We know
that Wedgwood had a collection, although he was
not a conchologist, yet it is not improbable that the
contemplation of these beautiful forms suggested
ideas and he derived many of his artistic shapes
from the forms of shells. The use of shell forms
was not unknown. Salt-glaze pieces repeatedly show
the pecten shell design, and Plymouth porcelain had
adopted shell designs in salt cellars and similar
pieces. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_225">p. 225</a>) a remarkable example
of a centre-piece in the form of a nautilus shell.
Some of the shell dishes have a faint wash in pink,
and yellow radiating bands, hardly perceptible, but
conveying the suggestion of the interior of the shell.</p>

<p>Queen's ware, when decorated, was of two classes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
(1) painted; (2) transfer-printed in red or puce or
black.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go into details in regard to
these two forms of decoration. It is interesting in
regard to the enamelling in colour to know that
Wedgwood sent his ware to Mrs. Warburton's factory
at Hot Lane to be painted. He also employed a
band of enamellers at Chelsea who had been trained
in the china factory. We reproduce an illustration
(<a href="#Page_233">p. 233</a>) of two painted queen's-ware plates from
the celebrated service executed for Catherine II. of
Russia. The enamel painting of the views and
borders cost Wedgwood over &pound;2,000. In the centre
of each piece is a scene representing some place of
interest in the country. Each view in this series
of British scenery is different, and there are some
twelve hundred. The body is in pale brimstone and
the view painted in a brownish purple; the border
was a wreath of mauve flowers and green leaves,
and, as will be seen in the illustrations, each plate
has a green frog in a reserve. This design has
puzzled many writers, but as the Messalina of the
North intended to place this service in her palace of
La Grenouill&egrave;re, near St. Petersburg&mdash;Grenouill&egrave;re
meaning a marshy place full of frogs&mdash;explains the
whimsical design of the frog on each plate.</p>

<p>This dinner and dessert service was completed in
1774 at a cost of about &pound;3,000. It was exhibited
in London, and set the town agog with amazement.
The rooms in Greek Street, Soho, were thronged with
fashionable people, and, as may be imagined, it gave
a great impetus to the manufacture of Wedgwood's
ware.</p>

<p>The other decoration employed by Wedgwood on
his cream ware was transfer printing. He availed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
himself at once of the new style of printing by
Sadler and Green on the glazed surface of his
ware, which was periodically sent to Liverpool to be
so decorated. In the earlier pieces the tile design is
evident, quite unsuitable for a round plate, in spite
of Wedgwood's addition of wreaths and ribbons in
enamel painting to help out the incongruity. In
early books illustrated by Bewick with square woodcuts
a similar use of garlands and ribbons as an
ornamental border is observed.</p>

<p>Nor was the cream body confined to strictly
domestic ware. Among his multifarious productions
Wedgwood made some fine coloured figures,
remarkable for strong modelling and subdued and
harmonious colouring. The large figures, such as
Fortitude, Charity, Ceres, Juno, Prudence, and many
others, are not always marked. "Fortitude" and
"Charity" both bear the impressed mark <span class="smcap">Wedgwood</span>,
the latter belonging to the series Faith,
Hope, and Charity designed for Wedgwood by Mrs.
Landr&eacute;, and a marked example is in the Willett
Collection. Many small coloured cream-ware busts
were made. We illustrate two typical examples
(<a href="#Page_233">p. 233</a>) of Rousseau and Voltaire. They were evidently
intended for the French market, and are very
dainty though somewhat highly-coloured likenesses
of two great Frenchmen. Jean-Jacques is portrayed
in Armenian costume, after the well-known portrait.
The coat is a chocolate brown and the stand is
marbled. Voltaire has a blue surcoat, a terra-cotta
cloak, and lilac vest.</p>

art was won. Nothing like it had ever been seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
pottery before, and the ware he produced in an endless
variety of forms which were termed "ornamental"
by him to distinguish them from the queen's ware,
or "useful" ware. About 1775&mdash;a great date in
Wedgwood's history&mdash;the jasper ware was perfected,
and from 1780 to 1795 is the period when it was at
its best, when he poured forth from Etruria, then
filled with a highly-trained body of workmen and
artists, his jasper ware, exquisite with grace and
beauty of form and fascinating in its charm of
dainty and subtle colour.</p>

<p>The spirit of classicism was in the air in the days
of Wedgwood. Dr. Johnson had imposed his ponderous
latinity on the world of letters. Alexander
Pope was still writing when Josiah was apprenticed
and known already as a "fine thrower." Homer's
<i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> had appeared in many editions
just prior to Wedgwood's manhood. The statues
of naval and military commanders in Westminster
Abbey were in Roman costume. The Brothers Adam
were in the heyday of their popularity. From sedan
chairs to silver-plate their style was the vogue. The
classical mouldings, capitals, and niches, the shell
flutings and the light garlands in the Adam style are
welcome sights in many otherwise dreary streets in
London. In furniture, the Adam style is as severe
as the French prototypes which had absorbed some
of the ancient spirit of Rome and Greece. As early
as 1763 Grimm wrote, "For some years past we
are beginning to inquire for antique ornaments and
forms. The interior and exterior decorations of
houses, furniture, materials of dress, work of the
goldsmiths, all bear alike the stamp of the Greeks.
The fashion passes from architecture to millinery;
our ladies have their hair dressed <i>&agrave; la Grecque</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>"
Men of thought joined in clamouring for simplicity,
and Diderot lent his powerful aid in heralding the
dawn of the revival of the antique long before the
France of Revolution days.</p>

<p>But eyes other than French were fixed on the
remote past. The excavations of Herculaneum and
Pompeii had given a new stimulus to arch&aelig;ological
research. In this country Sir William
Hamilton, as early as 1765, promoted the publication
of the magnificent work, "Greek, Roman, and
Etruscan Antiquities," illustrated from his collection.
It was a specially valuable exposition of the system
and methods and &aelig;sthetic value of classic art, especially
plastic art; and in promulgating this sumptuous
illustrated disquisition on the ancient potter's art Sir
William Hamilton laid modern workers in the same
field under a heavy debt. Incidentally it may be
mentioned that Sir William was the husband of the
beautiful Lady Hamilton.</p>

<p>So that in the midst of this eighteenth-century
classic revival Josiah Wedgwood was but the child
of his age, and, associated in partnership with
Bentley, a man of refined and scholarly tastes, he
entered into the new spirit with willing mind.
Adroitly seizing classic models, Wedgwood in his
art adapted all that was most suited to modern
requirements. Pope translated Homer into English
verse, and Wedgwood translated classic designs into
English pottery.</p>

<span class="f90">Subject&mdash;representing the Apotheosis of Virgil; surmounted by Pegasus cover.</span></div>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span></p>

<p>Wedgwood's jasper ware is of various colours&mdash;blue
in various tones, sage-green, olive-green, lilac,
pink, yellow, and black, and, of course, white, which
is its natural body without the addition of metallic
oxides. It is capable of taking a polish on the
lapidary's wheel. In use it was mainly employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
for ware of a highly ornamental character, though
it was also employed for utilitarian objects, such as
tea and coffee services, dishes, and flower vases, and
in plaques it was used as interior decorations in fireplaces
and in furniture. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_241">p. 241</a>) a
jasper ware diced pattern <i>Tea Set</i>, which shows how
wide a field Wedgwood covered with his new ware.</p>

<p>It is usually found with a ground of one colour,
such as blue, lilac, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;one of the seven&mdash;and
the ornament applied in relief is, as a rule, white.
It was Wedgwood's appreciation of antique gems
that suggested the idea of reproducing them in
earthenware, and in the period prior to Bentley's
death, in 1780, cameos, portrait medallions, and
plaques were mostly made.</p>

<p>There are two classes of jasper ware&mdash;<i>solid jasper</i>
and <i>jasper dip</i>. The difference is similar to that
between solid agate and surface agate. Solid jasper
is coloured throughout. That which is coloured
only on the surface is jasper dip. This latter
gives more delicate effects, and was employed,
after 1780, in the important series of classic vases
which required translucency and greater delicacy in
the white reliefs, which is especially effective in the
filmy garments and flowing draperies of the classic
figures.</p>

<p>Considerable progress had been made in Staffordshire
since Elers left in 1710, but it is the Elers
method of stamping the ornaments and applying
them to the body of the ware that Wedgwood
adopted. But there was more than enough originality
of invention in this jasper ware to carry his
fame to the confines of Europe. Blue and white
porcelain in imitation of his jasper was made at
S&egrave;vres, and other continental factories, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Meissen, Furstenburg, and Gros Breitenbach, made
similar echoes of this wonderful English jasper ware
of Josiah Wedgwood.</p>

<p>No illustrations can do justice to the charm and
tender colour of some of the finer examples of this
Wedgwood jasper ware, varying from pale lemon
colour to delicate mauve as a ground, and having
translucent diaphonous draperies in white standing
in relief in the groups of figures.</p>

<p>To the sense of touch fine old specimens of this
jasper ware are as soft as satin. Usually the dull
matt surface of this ware is left without polish,
though it is so dense and hard as to receive a high
polish, which was occasionally employed in the inside
of basins and cups and on the bevelled edges
of some of his cameos.</p>

<p>His classic subjects were no feeble echoes of
ancient art, but were executed from designs by a
band of great artists working together and saturated
with the spirit of the new classic revival. John
Flaxman, James Tassie, John Bacon, William Hackwood,
Thomas Stothard, George Stubbs, William
Greatbach, were all employed by Wedgwood. And
distinguished amateurs such as Lady Diana Beauclerk
and Lady Templeton supplied him with designs,
and it is interesting to note that Mrs. Wilcox, an
accomplished painter of figures and borders on his
Etruscan ware, was a daughter of Fry, the mezzotint
engraver and founder of the Bow porcelain factory.</p>

<p>We illustrate (<a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>) a fine jasper vase representing
<i>The Apotheosis of Virgil</i>, the cover surmounted by
a Pegasus. The square pedestal has griffins at the
corners. A companion vase, <i>The Apotheosis of
Homer</i>, changed owners at eight hundred guineas,
and is now in the possession of Lord Tweedmouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Wedgwood himself regarded his copy of the celebrated
Barberini vase, which was lent to him by the
Duke of Portland, as his masterpiece. This vase is
a cameo glass vase, which was discovered in the
middle of the seventeenth century in a marble sarcophagus
on the road to Frascati, two miles from
Rome. This vase belongs to the early part of the
third century. It was bought by Sir William
Hamilton for &pound;1,000, and subsequently purchased
by the Duke of Portland. This vase, of rich dark
blue glass, almost black, is decorated with opaque
white enamel cameos in relief cut with the most
extraordinary skill, and it stands as a superb example
of classic art. Strictly speaking, Wedgwood's
copy of this was at best a copy in one material of
the technique of another. But if it be not the
highest art to copy thus in intricate detail, yet it
must be admitted that such masterly elaboration had
never before been attempted by the potter, and the
early copies of Wedgwood (he set out to make only
fifty) stand unequalled as specimens of potting by
the hands of trained workmen directed by genius.</p>

<p><b>Wedgwood and his influence.</b>&mdash;As a final word on
Wedgwood and his influence, something should be
said as to the charge laid against him that he inaugurated
the factory system as applied to pottery.
There is no doubt that he organised what was before
his day a somewhat chaotic industry. And it is
certain that he trained his workmen to become
specialists, and that the system of the division of
labour was the order of the day at Etruria. But
how else could such an output as his be handled?
It has been advanced that the quaintness of the
peasant potter and his later development was submerged,
and that all individuality was lost under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the new system. There was a growing tendency
to develop mechanical perfection and to introduce
labour-saving appliances, but this was the spirit of
the oncoming modern age. Other factories, his contemporaries,
were adopting the same principles, and
those who think Wedgwood unoriginal or uninventive
are quite willing to credit him with all the inventiveness
and originality necessary to overturn the old
system. The truth lies between these two extremes.
Wedgwood, in common with his contemporaries, not
unwillingly embraced all the newest devices known.
It was Sadler and Green, of Liverpool, who together
in one day by their invention printed as many tiles
as it would have taken a hundred painters to do
in the same time. Similarly all over the country
artisans in the china trade were becoming specialised.
There were the enamellers at Chelsea and other places,
and a little examination will show that Wedgwood
did not inaugurate this modern factory method, but
without doubt, in common with all other master potters,
he had to go with the times. Trade rivalry was very
strong, and competition was not unknown when every
potter in Staffordshire was jealously watching the
latest improvement of his neighbour. But to saddle
Josiah Wedgwood with the responsibility of stamping
out original talent is beside the mark. His life-work
stands impregnable against petty assault. "In
a word, no other potter of modern times has so successfully
welded into one harmonious whole the prose
and the poetry of the ceramic art."</p>

<p class="ph2">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="f75">THE SCHOOL OF WEDGWOOD<br />
1760&ndash;1810</span></p>

<p class="chapblock">William Adams (of Greengates) (1789&ndash;1805)&mdash;John Turner
(of Lane End) (1739&ndash;1786)&mdash;The plagiarists of Wedgwood&mdash;The
Wedgwood influence&mdash;The passing of
classicism&mdash;Table of Marks&mdash;Prices.</p>


<p>Potters who followed Wedgwood may be divided
into three classes. Men such as John Turner and
William Adams, who were competitors with him in
friendly rivalry, each striving to emulate the successes
of the other, and each doing original and
independent work. Indebted, and greatly indebted
to Wedgwood as these potters were, they produced
work equal with his in technique. The blue jasper
of William Adams, if anything, is rather finer than
that of his master. John Turner, of Lane End,
made jasper from a different formula to Wedgwood,
being more porcellanous in character. These men,
his friends and intimates, and Palmer, of Hanley,
who was first to apply bas-reliefs to his black vases,
in 1769, may be said to represent original research,
as compared with uninventive copying.</p>

<p>The second class, which includes contemporaries
such as Elijah Mayer, and Palmer, of Hanley, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
must be included here (in spite of his streak of
originality above alluded to, and his fine use of
gilding to granitic ware), and Neale, his brother-in-law,
and Voyez, the modeller, and Hollins, may all
be said to be plagiarists who lived largely on Wedgwood's
jasper and basalt ware, as well as several
schools such as Hartley Greens (of Leeds), and
Swansea and Spode, and many others who followed
his cream-ware designs. In regard to Palmer and
Neale and Voyez the case is very strong, as they are
stated to have forged the mark "Wedgwood &amp;
Bentley" in some of their medallions; but against
the others the case must not be pressed too closely,
as they undoubtedly displayed a fertility of invention
and an originality after they had once learned the
Wedgwood manner. Leeds, in particular, having
caught the spirit that Wedgwood had transplanted
from the silversmith to his dessert services, produced
cream-ware rivalling that of Etruria.</p>

<p>Tennyson had a set of verses which illustrate this
situation. He tells of him who "cast to earth a
seed" which grew so tall "it wore a crown of light."</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"But thieves from o'er the wall</div>
<div class="i2">Stole the seed by night."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sown far and wide in every town, it won universal
admiration, and, says the poet&mdash;who, by the way,
was thinking of plagiarists of his own style&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Most can raise the flowers now,</div>
<div class="i2">For all have got the seed."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We must make one other point; it was Wedgwood
who lighted the way even to his source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
inspiration. He made no secret of his indebtedness
to the art of the silversmith, and in recognising in
the antiquarian works of Count Caylus and Sir
William Hamilton a new field, he left it open for
others to go to the same original sources, nor were
his contemporaries slow in doing this. So that, in a
measure, this second class of potters may be exonerated
from the charge of plagiarism when we find
them striking out for themselves.</p>

<p>Chippendale, when he promulgated his "Director"
giving designs for furniture, straightway started a
school of cabinet-makers, who worked after his
designs in every locality in England. These early
pioneers in art&mdash;Chippendale, the masterly adapter
of all that was best on the Continent, and Wedgwood,
translator of classicism into English pottery&mdash;worked
with broad and generous spirit, and their
contemporaries and those who came immediately
after them helped themselves liberally to the overflowing
profusion of ideas.</p>

<p>The third class is the great crowd of lesser men,
potters who claim little attention for original work,
but who are remembered as producing, as an echo
to the great classic revival, designs and shapes and
copies of Wedgwood's ware, sometimes in stoneware
for jugs, and more often in cream-ware, without an
added touch of originality. In this decadent period,
when not only in Staffordshire but in other parts of
the country this was being largely done, and not
always done well, though there are exceptions to
which we shall allude later, one is reminded of
the pregnant words of Goethe: "There are many
echoes, but few voices."</p>

<p><b>William Adams (1745&ndash;1805).</b>&mdash;The Adams family are
renowned in Staffordshire as being among the oldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
potters in the country. In connection with classic
ware William Adams, of Greengates, is pre-eminent.
At his death, in 1805, the works were carried on by
Benjamin Adams till 1820. There is considerable
confusion between contemporary members of this
family, both of the same name, William Adams
(of Cobridge), William Adams (of Greenfield), and
the subject of the present remarks, William Adams,
of Greengates, who commenced as master potter
there in 1789. There were other firms, such as
J. Adams &amp; Co., or Adams &amp; Bromley, who made
jasper ware between about 1870 and 1886, and who
stamped their ware "<span class="smcap">Adams</span>," or "<span class="smcap">Adams &amp; Co.</span>"
This, of course, does not come into the realm of
collecting, and this latter firm has nothing to do
with the old-established family of Adams. But
collectors cannot be too careful when auction catalogues
describe such ware as "Adams."</p>

<p>The beautiful Adams blue which is of a violet tone
is much admired, and in the finely-modelled classic
reliefs the style is less frigid than Wedgwood, as
William Adams drew his inspiration more from
Latin than Greek models. As a rule his jasper is
a trifle more waxen than that of Wedgwood, but
never glossy. William Adams was a favourite pupil
of Wedgwood, and was doubtless indebted to him
for the guidance that set the young potter to work
in friendly and amicable rivalry with his late master.</p>

<p class="p2">As a modeller he was of exceptional merit, and it
is known that he designed, himself, several of his
finest pieces, such as the <i>Seasons</i>, his <i>Venus Bound</i>,
and <i>Cupid Disarmed</i>, his <i>Pandora</i>, <i>Psyche trying one
of Cupid's Darts</i>, and the <i>Muses</i>. Monglott, a Swiss
artist, was employed by him on jasper vases, and it is
believed that Enoch Wood is responsible for designing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the hunting scenes which appear on the fine
stoneware jugs and tankards similar in style to the
Turner jug illustrated (<a href="#Page_267">p. 267</a>). Many of his jugs
had silver mounts.</p>

<p>In regard to marks, that usually found is <span class="smcap">Adams</span>
impressed. Sometimes, though rarely, the mark is
<span class="smcap">Adams &amp; Co.</span>; and later his son, Benjamin Adams,
had the impressed mark <span class="smcap">B. Adams</span>, which appears
on stoneware and blue printed ware.</p>

<p>To those who desire to familiarise themselves with
the genius of William Adams, there is a special
volume by Mr. William Turner, entitled "William
Adams, an Old English Potter" (Chapman &amp; Hall,
1904), which is a full and learned monograph, dealing
in thorough manner with the productions of William
Adams and of his kinsfolk, the Adams family of
potters.</p>

<p>We illustrate one of a pair of jasper vases in blue
and white by Adams, in date about 1790. The
classic figure subjects, as will be seen, display a
simplicity and exquisite grace of modelling and
arrangement not surpassed even by Wedgwood (see
<a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>).</p>

<p><b>John Turner, of Lane End (1739&ndash;1786).</b>&mdash;Wedgwood
and Turner were intimates, and in considering
Turner we must regard him as a friendly neighbour,
as well as a rival potter. He made some
remarkably fine jasper, though it differed in its body
very greatly from that of Wedgwood, being more
closely allied with porcelain. It contained no barytes
in its composition. In design Turner, though not
imitative, followed the Greek school and produced,
as a modeller himself, some exquisitely proportioned
pieces. We illustrate a fine vase in blue-and-white
jasper which is especially graceful in design, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
severity being relieved by the delicacy of the fine
subject in relief of <i>Diana in her Chariot</i> drawing a
pair of goats and accompanied by flying cherubs
(see <a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>). This subject, it will be noticed, is
reproduced in a transfer-printed jug illustrated in a
later chapter (<a href="#Page_319">p. 319</a>).</p>

<p>But it is in the unglazed stoneware that he surpassed
anything his contemporaries had done. It
was about 1780 that he discovered, after hunting
for clay even so far afield as Cornwall, the precise
earth he wanted in his own neighbourhood at
Longton. In colour it was a warm biscuit tone, and
it was capable of being modelled with exactitude
into fine sharp designs in relief. In stoneware jugs
with classic figures in relief he set the fashion for
half a century. His teapots and coffee-pots are
models of graceful design. We illustrate a fine
example of a <i>Teapot</i> (<a href="#Page_267">p. 267</a>), with the lid perfectly
fitting, made to slide in a groove, and showing in
clear relief the style of ornamentation for which
Turner became so renowned. The other illustration,
on the same page, of an equally perfect
<i>Stoneware Jug</i> with metal mounts, shows a slight
departure from classic ornament. The figures are
in old English costume, and are engaged in archery.
It will thus be seen that even in the early days there
was exhibited a tendency to depart from classic
figure design and turn to equally graceful but homelier
subjects. Possibly this influence may have been
due to Enoch Wood, who is believed to have been
employed by Turner as a modeller; but accurate
information regarding Turner's modellers is not
known.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned wares, Turner also
made black basalt of very high quality, being preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
by some connoisseurs to that of Wedgwood.
He also was the first to introduce under-glaze
printing into Staffordshire, and although he did not
introduce the "willow pattern" (Spode brought that
from Caughley), he made ware with this pattern
printed in under-glaze blue, and his plates and
dishes have perforated borders. We illustrate a
fine example of this ware (<a href="#Page_331">p. 331</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Plagiarists of Wedgwood.</b>&mdash;We have seen that
John Turner, of Lane End, that William Adams,
of Greengates, came under the strong influence of
Wedgwood, but were no more imitators, in the broad
sense, than Gainsborough and Romney may be said
to be imitators of Sir Joshua Reynolds. It must be
allowed in art that a school may arise under the
guidance of some remarkable genius who tinges the
originality of his contemporaries with his own master
mind. Wedgwood had the inspiration to transplant
classic decoration into Staffordshire&mdash;the rest was
easy; having shown the way, crowds of lesser men
seized the new ideas with avidity.</p>

<p>Chief among the direct copyists was Henry Palmer.
He had a spark of originality, as we have seen,
anticipating Wedgwood by some five years in applying
bas-reliefs to his black vases, and the sprinkled
marbled ware touched with gold was another success
of his, but here his ingenuity ended. He must have
been a great thorn in Wedgwood's side, for he is
said to have procured every new pattern on its
appearance and copied it. Voyez, who was a
modeller and not a potter, assisted in this nefarious
traffic; but Voyez, in spite of his rascality,
was a clever modeller, and struck out a new line in
his rustic or "Fair Hebe" jugs. He was employed
at one time by Wedgwood, and probably by Ralph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Wood. Voyez specialised on the intaglio seals, and
added Wedgwood and Bentley's names to his handiwork.
On other intaglios, equally imitative, and on
vases is the name <span class="smcap">Palmer</span> or the initials H. P.</p>

<p>Wedgwood himself&mdash;as do collectors nowadays&mdash;was
obliged to acknowledge the fine quality of the
work of Palmer and of Neale, for he admitted to
Bentley that they were "serious competitors," and
he evidently feared their activity, as he says, "We
must be progressing or we shall have them treading
on our heels."</p>

<p>The sagacity of Wedgwood's remark is obvious,
for an examination of the Neale-and-Palmer jasper
and other ware reveals an amazing mastery of
technique. It is finely potted and well balanced
in ornament and design. If it were not for the
impressed mark such vases might readily pass as
Wedgwood. It is not improbable that in the middle
nineteenth century the names both of Adams and
Palmer and Neale were ground out of the bases of
some of their finer vases by ingenious persons, who
passed them off as the work of Wedgwood.</p>

<p><b>Marks&mdash;Palmer, Neale, Wilson.</b>&mdash;In regard to marks,
<span class="smcap">H. Palmer</span> or <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>. <span class="smcap">Hanley</span> is the earliest&mdash;sometimes
only the initials H. P. About 1776 he
entered into partnership with his brother-in-law, and
sometimes the mark <span class="smcap">Neale</span> alone is found and often
<span class="smcap">Neale &amp; Co.</span> These marks are usually in circles;
on one piece appears <span class="smcap">I. Neale</span>, with the word
<span class="smcap">Hanly</span> (spelt wrongly) beneath. About 1778
Robert Wilson joined the firm, and after 1788 his
name alone appears. Stoneware jugs&mdash;drab ground
with cupids in relief&mdash;baskets, and cream-ware are
often found marked <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> surmounted by a crown
with the letter C above. Sometimes this is present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
without the name. Wilson, too, is remembered for
having introduced chalk into the body of his cream-ware,
which was of exceptional value in whitening
the ware and rendering it more adapted for under-glaze
printing. At Wilson's death, in 1802, David
Wilson succeeded to the pottery, and the firm shortly
after became D. Wilson &amp; Sons. These Wilsons
made pink lustre, similar to that of Wedgwood, and
also silver lustre, upon some of which the name of
Wilson is impressed. This brings the factory down
to 1820, when it passed into other hands.</p>

<p>We have seen that Adams and Turner and Palmer
and Neale came more or less into touch with
Wedgwood as contemporary rivals. Before coming
to the crowd of lesser men, or lesser-known men,
we must not omit Josiah Spode, who was a colleague
of Wedgwood under Whieldon; Elijah Mayer, whose
black basalt was almost equal to that of Wedgwood,
and whose enamel cream-ware stands artistically
very high; and Samuel Hollins, of Shelton, with
fine red or chocolate ware, having as dense a character
as Wedgwood's imitations of the Elers ware,
and Hollins in his jasper produced some fine examples
with original combinations of colours.</p>

<p><b>Josiah Spode</b> the First (there are three potters in
succession of that name) made, in common with
other potters, the black basalt ware from 1770,
when he commenced as potter, and he produced
stoneware jugs similar in character to those of
Adams and Turner, following the sporting subjects
in relief and departing from the ultra-classical subjects
of Wedgwood. This class of jug and mug was
made by many potters&mdash;its character was English,
and it was evidently popular. An illustration of the
type appears on page 277. Davenport, of Longport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
made the same pattern; it was made at Castleford,
near Leeds, and Hollins and others adopted the
design in relief of a fox-hunt, with horsemen dismounted
preparing to join others at the "kill,"
which is shown on the reverse. In fact, it was
almost as much copied in stoneware as the "willow
pattern" was in blue-printed ware.</p>

<p>But Josiah Spode is best known as devoting considerable
skill in the improvement of under-glaze
blue-printing cream-ware. In 1783 he brought two
workmen into Staffordshire from Caughley, where
under-glaze blue-printing under Thomas Turner was
in full swing. Spode was not the first to introduce
under-glaze blue-printing into Staffordshire; this is
due to John Turner, of Lane End (whom we have
described, maker of the fine jasper-ware and stoneware
teapots and jugs), not to be confounded with
Thomas Turner, the maker of porcelain at Caughley,
who introduced the "willow pattern" in 1780, which
same design was introduced into Staffordshire in
1784 by Spode&mdash;a year after his two men came
over from Caughley. But this and blue transfer-printing
is dealt with in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>Something should be said of Josiah Spode the
Second (1797&ndash;1827), who continued the blue-printed
ware, and produced a great number of stoneware
jugs with decoration in relief similar to those we
have alluded to, and produced jasper ware in blue
and white with the familiar subjects of Wedgwood's
day. To him must be given the credit of introducing
colour into Staffordshire earthenware, colour such as
it had never before attempted. His fine imitations
of the Derby-Japan porcelain designs mark a new
era in Staffordshire earthenware.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">The Spodes brought something new into Staffordshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
earthenware. The elder Spode evidently had
a strong love for Oriental subjects, as in the "willow
pattern," which he "lifted" from Caughley porcelain.
He broke away&mdash;and others followed him
readily enough&mdash;from the cupids and psyches and
gods and goddesses of the old world, and followed
the newer-imported ideas in Chinese taste, now the
fashion at Worcester, Bow, and other china factories.
Leeds and Swansea were not slow in snatching at
this new Oriental style of decoration.</p>

<p>In the Staffordshire cream-ware jug we previously
illustrated painted in under-glaze colours, somewhat
brown owing to the imperfect knowledge of the
Staffordshire potter in under-glaze work submitted
to great heat, we see an example of painted design
in Oriental style, which came shortly to be more
perfectly done in under-glaze blue, as in the painted
plate of Leeds ware illustrated (<a href="#Page_303">p. 303</a>).</p>

<p>But much in the same manner work such as the
painted scenery on services like that made by Wedgwood
for Catherine II. was shortly supplanted by
black and purple and red transfer-printing done at
Liverpool, so the short-lived under-glaze blue painting
on earthenware was quickly killed by Spode and
the other Staffordshire potters when they rapidly
developed the under-glaze transfer-printing in blue.</p>

<p>It was quite an original departure, and owed
nothing to Josiah Wedgwood (who never employed
transfer-printing in blue), though it was adopted
very successfully by the firm after his death. And
Josiah Spode the elder most certainly had a strong
influence in the potters of his day in acclimatising
the "willow pattern" in Staffordshire, and in assimilating
the best efforts of Chinese decoration as
applied to blue-and-white ware. And Josiah Spode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the Second, with equal originality, took up the
next stage in adopting the gorgeous colouring of
Japan.</p>

<p>This brings the story of the development of Wedgwood's
cream-ware up to modern times. And the
same chain of development might be traced in the
history of some of the other great potters whose
descendants still carry on the manufacture. Cream-ware
at first painted, then transfer-printed in black
or red, then painted in blue under-glaze&mdash;which was
killed by the blue under-glaze printing&mdash;finally emulated
the rich colours and gilding of porcelain.</p>

<p>To return to <b>Elijah Mayer</b> (1770&ndash;1813). From
1786 he appears to have produced black basalt
tea ware; his fine teapots with the seated figure at
the apex are well known, and his unglazed cane-coloured
ware is much prized, with its simple
decorations in lines of green and blue. We illustrate
(<a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>) an example of a <i>Black Basalt Teapot</i>,
and beneath it an illustration of a similar model
by Birch, showing the imitativeness of this school of
potters and how difficult it is to identify specimens.
His cream-ware deserves especial attention, as his
enamelling was in very artistic manner, and it stands
out prominently among a crowd of imitators of
Wedgwood's cream-ware borders. Every maker not
only took the body of the ware, but in so doing
he followed the designs by Flaxman or some of
Wedgwood's other artists, still found in the old
pattern-books to-day at Etruria. As an example
of this imitation in detail, see the Swansea cream-ware
plate illustrated (<a href="#Page_397">p. 397</a>).</p>

<p>Mayer made black glazed tea ware, and this, when
unmarked, is very commonly attributed by beginners
to Turner. The marks impressed are <span class="smcap">E. Mayer</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and after 1820 <span class="smcap">E. Mayer &amp; Son</span>. At a later
period the mark was <span class="smcap">Joseph Mayer</span>.</p>

<p><b>Samuel Hollins</b> (1774&ndash;1816), with his red and
chocolate unglazed ware decorated with ornament
in the Elers manner and made from the clay at
Bradwell Wood, is deservedly noteworthy as well
as for several important departures in colour in the
stoneware teapots and coffee-pots which he made
of green, with touches of applied ornament in blue
jasper. He followed silver designs, and avoided the
cold, classic forms of Wedgwood. He departed from
the straight lines of the Turner teapot. He loved
ornament, and there is a touch of elaboration in his
design, as though attempting to shake off the severe
formality of the Brothers Adam style of design, and
he strongly loved colour.</p>

<p>Samuel Hollins was one of the proprietors in the
New Hall china works, and his successors were T.
and J. Hollins, who continued to make jasper ware
in the style of Wedgwood. Their names are impressed
on many examples.</p>

<p><b>The Wedgwood influence.</b>&mdash;In the latter days of the
eighteenth century and the early days of the nineteenth,
the direct influence of Wedgwood became
something more remote. But even in early nineteenth-century
days there were undeniable traces of
the old models and the old form of ware. Take, for
example, the unmarked early nineteenth-century
<i>Black Basalt Teapot</i> in the form of a barrel, with the
grape-vine ornament in relief, and the pine cone at
top of lid (illustrated <a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>). Undoubtedly this has
left all classic form, but it has retained the technique
of Wedgwood. In some of the buff-coloured, unglazed
stoneware jugs which are unmarked, there
is the inclination to follow the sporting subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in relief, which Adams and Turner and Spode so
successfully adopted, and the twisted snake-handle
and reptilian-modelled mouth become original in
treatment. In general, it may be said, that the
classic influence remained for a considerable time in
the stoneware of various kinds, but in the cream-ware
which is the main stream of English earthenware,
the forms and the ornamentation more rapidly
departed from the styles of Wedgwood's queen's ware.</p>

<p>Hence we find two opposing influences working
against each other in the Staffordshire potters'
minds. The best of them in their highest flights
essayed to make jasper, or to copy or emulate
Wedgwood's classic style in vases and important
ornamental pieces. Most of them largely made the
stoneware of various colours, and also the black
basalt. All of them made cream-ware, which was
the staple ware of Staffordshire, in a thousand different
forms. As time went on all except cream-ware
began to deteriorate from the earliest prototypes,
and the later forms are debased in design and inferior
in potting.</p>

<p><b>The passing of classicism.</b>&mdash;From the first there were
those who were classic only by compulsion. Wedgwood
was regarded as too classic for vulgar tastes.
The cream-ware and the coloured figures display a
ready appreciation of public wants. Even Voyez
descended to rusticity in his jugs. Spode had a
leaning for Oriental subjects in his blue printed ware,
which was quickly adopted by Leeds. Adams leaned
to landscape subjects after Claude and English
scenery. Nor was this all. The cream-ware figures
and the mugs and jugs provided full scope for the
potter's fancy in political, satirical, patriotic, and
humorous and fancy subjects. From Sunderland to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Swansea the cream-ware took to itself more homely
sentiments and more characteristic design. It became,
during the last quarter of the eighteenth
century and the first quarter of the nineteenth, as
English as if the gods and goddesses had never
descended into Staffordshire, and as though Wedgwood
had never been.</p>

<p>Most of this cream-ware was transfer-printed, the
Caxtons of Staffordshire had found blank spots
enough to fill on their white ware, and in filling them
they have left us a permanent record of popular
feeling which was at the time strong enough to induce
them to rush into print on every conceivable subject
with queer engraved decoration and whimsically
illiterate verse.</p>

<p><b>Marks.</b>&mdash;The following are some of the names,
mostly found as impressed marks, on ware of the
Wedgwood school, in date from 1760 to 1835, a
period of three-quarters of a century. In many
cases in addition to ware bearing traces of a classic
influence, the potters made cream ware with blue-printed
decoration, a style which was not employed
at Etruria until the second Wedgwood period, on the
death of Josiah Wedgwood in 1795.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

of interest, the class of ware associated with the
potter is given.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Leeds Marks&mdash;The best period of Leeds&mdash;Leeds Cream
Ware&mdash;Blue and White Ware&mdash;Leeds Ware decorated
at Lowestoft, Castleford, Jackfield, Rockingham,
Sunderland, and Newcastle&mdash;Table of Marks&mdash;Prices.</p>


<p>Leeds claims notice mainly on account of its fine
cream ware that was produced in the period from
1783 to about 1800 when the factory was at its
zenith. The date which commences its known
history is the year 1760, a most pregnant year in
the history of pottery. Before that there always
exists some doubt as to the exact date or the
particular maker. "Early Staffordshire" or
"Whieldon" are as definite as most collectors
dare go.</p>

<p>In 1762 Wedgwood's cream ware was perfected,
and all Staffordshire was aflame with the prospects
of something that at last was to stand artistically
side by side with Bow and Chelsea and Worcester
and Derby and Plymouth. It did nothing of the
sort, but still it was the dream of the Staffordshire
potters that it should by reason of its cheapness
smash the new china factories, and it seems to
have had no little share in doing this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1775 the Leeds pottery was in the hands of
Humble and Green. In 1783 it was known as
Hartley, Greens &amp; Co., and for the next ten
years some splendid examples of cream ware were
produced rivalling the best productions of Wedgwood,
at first imitative, but later strikingly
original, and possessed of extraordinary artistic
qualities. Down to the opening days of the nineteenth
century the trade in cream ware was
considerable. Pattern books and catalogues were
issued in French and German and Spanish, and
the output from Leeds was very considerable, and
the continental trade very extensive, especially
with Northern Europe.</p>

<p>From 1825 to 1832 the firm was known as
Samuel Wainwright &amp; Co. From 1832 to 1840
the name changed again to the Leeds Pottery
Company, under the managership of Stephen
Chapel, who, together with his brother James,
held the pottery till 1847. In 1850 Warburton,
Britton &amp; Co. were proprietors until 1863, and
Richard Britton &amp; Sons carried on the works until
1878 when the factory closed.</p>

<p><b>Forgeries of Leeds Ware.</b>&mdash;Leeds ware has appealed,
on account of its artistic qualities, to so wide a
circle of collectors and admirers that it has had
the honour of being forged with intent to deceive.
Nearly all these pieces are marked either "Leeds
Pottery," "L.P.," or "Leeds P." In addition to
being copied for sale to unwary collectors some of
the basket and other patterns have been of recent
years made in Germany for sale in this country.
But to any one who has had the opportunity of
handling genuine old Leeds ware the lightness in
weight, the fine finish, and the peculiar colour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the body, especially the slightly green tinge in the
old Leeds glaze are never to be mistaken. The
modern copies lack the fine potting, and they are
slightly heavier in weight, and always without
exception have a thick white, glassy glaze which
fills the corners of the pierced work, and shows
the touch of modern haste.</p>

<p><b>Leeds Marks.</b>&mdash;The following marks occur on
Leeds ware, largely on the blue-printed ware which
was after 1791, for many of the finest examples of
cream ware are unmarked. However, these marks
used may be a guide: <span class="smcap">Leeds</span> <b>*</b> <span class="smcap">Pottery</span> (often
printed twice over and crossing at right angles),
<span class="smcap">Hartley, Greens, &amp; Co., Leeds Pottery</span> (either
in two lines or in a semicircle), also the initials
L.P. In its latter stage (1863&ndash;1878) R. Britton and
Sons marked their ware R. B. &amp; S. with the initial L
enclosed in a circle.</p>

<p>The Don pottery at Swinton near Leeds,
established about 1790, came in prominence about
1800, when one of the brothers Green, of Leeds,
became owner. It passed through various vicissitudes
of fortune, a comparison of the old pattern
books show that many pieces made at the Don
pottery were originated at Leeds. In 1834 it was
purchased by Samuel Barker, and in 1882 it was
still known as Samuel Barker and Sons.</p>

<p>The Don Pottery mark was both printed and
impressed <span class="smcap">Don Pottery</span> in its early days prior
to 1834, and sometimes the word <span class="smcap">Green</span> appears
above. Later in the Barker <i>r&eacute;gime</i> a demi-lion
rampant holding in his paws a pennon with the
words "Don Pottery" was used, sometimes with the
word <span class="smcap">Barker</span>, and sometimes with the initials
S. B. &amp; S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The best period.</b>&mdash;But it is chiefly the best period,
that is, Hartley, Greens &amp; Co., from 1781 to about 1805,
which appeals to collectors of old Leeds, though a
pattern book was issued as late as 1814, which still
maintained the old traditions, but when Hartley died
in 1820 the factory practically went to pieces. The
two brothers Green and William Hartley nobly carried
on the manufacture of cream ware. At first they
looked to Wedgwood for inspiration, but very shortly
introduced a lightness of design in the exquisite and
intricately pierced patterns in the borders, and
original touches in the feather edges in relief
and twisted handles and the floral terminals. The
gadrooned or fluted edges of Leeds plates were
sometimes painted in blue. The ware is extremely
light in weight, and varies in colour from a pale,
sometimes a very pale, cream colour to a light buff.
We have seen how Wedgwood invented punches
at first for his pierced cream ware. But he at a later
stage had the perforations punched <i>en bloc</i>. But
in Leeds ware each perforation is done separately by
hand, and the edges are sharp and clean-cut. These
are in the shape of diamonds, squares, ovals, and
hearts, arranged in geometrical patterns. The
characteristic feature of Leeds ware is the varied use
of this pierced work in the rims of plates and dishes
and trays and cups. This work was carried into
such unlikely portions of the ware such as bases of
candlesticks or plinths of massive candelabra. In
conception no doubt it followed the work of the
silversmith, but as it developed it acquired the
character of some of the finest Oriental types of this
class of ware, and in particular the Leeds potters
achieved a ceramic triumph when they made, in
the delicately pierced work with small apertures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
something not dissimilar to the rice-grain form
found on old Chinese white ware which in the case
of Chinese wine-cups of white porcelain is filled
with glaze. This especially fine style is at the
present day being carried out by the potters at
the Copenhagen porcelain factory. When held up
to the light this porcelain of China and of Denmark
is singularly beautiful, and looks as though it is
perforated&mdash;but is not.</p>

<p>If Leeds at first copied Wedgwood and the
Staffordshire cream-ware patterns the Staffordshire
potters were not slow to return the compliment
when they saw that Leeds had a note of originality,
consequently we find many salt-glaze pieces of
identical shape to some of Hartley, Greens &amp; Co.'s
patterns. It is improbable that salt-glaze ware
was ever made at Leeds, though before salt-glaze
was as well understood as it is now much of it was
wrongly attributed to Leeds.</p>

<p>We give an illustration (<a href="#Page_319">p. 319</a>) of a salt-glaze
plate which has the typical perforated edge of Leeds
cream ware, and is decorated with a transfer-print of
a fable subject, illustrating "Hercules and the Waggoner."
But Leeds very early did its own printing,
and only the early examples were sent to Liverpool
to Sadler and Green. At this time salt-glaze ware
was in a bad way, and every effort was being made
to compete with cream ware its new rival, and with
porcelain which had struck the first blow at its
supremacy as domestic ware. When cream ware
was decorated by transfer-printing salt-glaze followed
the new fashion, and leaving its lofty
ideals of undecorated form it hastily assumed the
enamel colouring of the English porcelain.</p>

<p><b>Leeds Cream Ware.</b>&mdash;The various classes of Leeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
cream ware may be roughly divided into two classes:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Plain or undecorated</i>, in which (especially by
reason by the grace and lightness of structure
imparted by the nicely balanced perforations) artistic
excellence is reached by <i>form</i> alone.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Decorated cream ware.</i> Decorated with enamel
colours, green, red, lilac, and yellow being usually
found, or transfer-printed in the early manner of
Liverpool&mdash;black, puce, or red, or later by printing
in blue.</p>

<p>In regard to the finer specimens of the cream
ware dependent on form and exhibiting especial
delicacy in the treatment of the pierced work, the
illustrations here given convey a pictorial representation
of the great variety and fertility of the
design.</p>

<p>The two magnificent centre-pieces represent Leeds
cream ware at its highest. The favourite form of
the centre-piece is that in which tiers of escallop
shells are supported by dolphins or by ornamental
brackets. The left-hand centre-piece illustrated
(<a href="#Page_291">p. 291</a>) is in the form of the trunk of a tree, supporting
four tiers of leaf-shaped dishes. The piece is
surmounted by a classical draped figure. It is
noticeable that the brackets have every resemblance
to metal design. These large centre-pieces are made
to take apart. This example illustrated takes into
four pieces, which fit into each other with great
accuracy, showing great technical perfection in
potting. It is no less than 4 feet in height, and one
of the largest pieces known. Its rich cream colour,
the perfection of the glaze, and the graceful proportion
in the structure, and the modelled figure have
won for this and similar creations of Leeds the
admiration of all connoisseurs.</p>

<p>The other centre-piece illustrated is 30 inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
height, and is constructed in the form of hanging
baskets separate and removable. These baskets,
which are of exquisite pierced work, are in three
tiers supported from the central column. The top
consists of a vase resting upon four winged figures.
The piece is surmounted by a classical draped figure
of Flora with a cornucopia.</p>

<p>Such pieces as these hold the blue riband of
Leeds cream ware, and collectors who wish to find
specimens only approximating to them in grace and
beauty have to search as far afield as Russia and
Sweden before they can hope to gratify their
desire.</p>

<p>Another class typical of Leeds cream ware in its
highest moods is the large class consisting of handsome
cruets, baskets, and a great variety of candlesticks.
The pierced work in these articles is of very
fine character, and the design is happily lightened by
this style of decoration. In regard to imitations of
this cream ware, as has already been mentioned, they
are heavier, are thickly coated with white glaze,
whereas old Leeds pieces are extremely dainty and
light in weight, and when the glaze is seen in the
crevices where it may have run it is of a peculiar
green, due to the use of arsenic.</p>

<p>We illustrate two groups of Leeds cream ware,
exhibiting the perfection of its pierced work. The
chestnut basket in the upper group is partly derived
from Wedgwood's model. There is an indication
in the use of the sphinx in the pair of candlesticks
of one of Wedgwood's models in basalt. But the
treatment here is more graceful, and the character
imparted by Leeds to its cream ware is peculiarly
its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Leeds cream ware undecorated plates have a
great variety of patterns in the pierced borders,
and are always attractive to collectors. Some
of the Leeds plates, with blue painted feathered
edge, had either a crest or printed design in middle.
In regard to colour, there are fine under-glaze blue
plates in which there is as strong a leaning to Oriental
pagoda designs as at Bow and Worcester. We
illustrate a fine plate of this nature (<a href="#Page_303">p. 303</a>), similar
in design to plates impressed <span class="smcap">Astbury</span> of Staffordshire.
Under-glaze blue-printing (black printing
over-glaze was done, but not to the same extent as
in Staffordshire) was introduced about 1790. The
willow pattern, among others, was a favourite
design, and most of these printed blue plates are
marked.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to the collector to know that
there are marks on the old blue-printed Leeds ware
which tell their own story. These marks were made
by the "cockspurs" placed between each plate to
keep them separate in the kiln. There were three of
these little tripods of earthenware placed between
each plate. They made, as they had only one point
at their apex, only three "spur" marks on the front
of the plates in the border, and nine "spurs" at the
back, in groups of three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></span></p>

<p>In regard to subjects in colour it may be mentioned
that a good many Leeds jugs bear names and dates
upon them, from about 1769 to 1786. These enamel
colours are green, red, lilac, and buff, and are not
dissimilar to those employed at Lowestoft. We
illustrate a fine Leeds mug with the characteristic
twisted handle (<a href="#Page_303">p. 303</a>), having Oriental figure in
colour and dated and inscribed. The following
curious and gruesome verses appear on it. Inside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
mug is a modelled frog, as found in Sunderland
examples.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Then follows "I. C. U. B. YY for me" (I see you be
too wise for me). "<span class="smcap">Samuel Cudworth, 1777.</span>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Leeds Ware decorated at Lowestoft.</b>&mdash;There is a
connection between Leeds and Lowestoft. It
appears that some of the Leeds ware was sent
undecorated to Allen, of Lowestoft, who decorated
it there and refired it, disposing of it on his own
account. The fine Leeds mug having the painted
decoration, over-glaze of course, of a vessel, and
entitled "Homeward Bound" (illustrated, <a href="#Page_299">p. 299</a>),
is typical of this work of Allen at its best. He
appears to have procured ware from Turner and
other Staffordshire potters for decoration and sale
by himself. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_303">p. 303</a>), a Staffordshire
jug painted by Allen, of Lowestoft, representing
a local scene, recognisable by the tower in the background.
He inscribed it "A Trifle from Lowestoft."
This is enamel work over-glaze, the key pattern at the
rim is under-glaze and was done in Staffordshire.</p>

<p>Another Leeds jug decorated by Allen is that
illustrated (<a href="#Page_299">p. 299</a>), bearing the verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"From hence to the deep</div>
<div class="i0">May division be tost</div>
<div class="i0">And prudence recovre</div>
<div class="i0">What folly have lost."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>
<p>The "have" is a peculiarly Suffolk idiom. The
floral scrolls are in the usual low tones of Lowestoft
colouring.</p>

<p><b>Castleford</b> (1790&ndash;1820).&mdash;This factory, some twelve
miles from Leeds, was established about 1790, contemporary
with the establishment of the Don Pottery
near Doncaster. This Castleford factory, under the
proprietor, David Dunderdale, commenced to make
cream ware, black basalt, and the usual stoneware
teapots with ornaments in relief. The mark employed
by this factory, when it was used, is <span class="smcap">D. D. &amp; Co.,
Castleford</span>. This is impressed, and is found on
various imitative ware, such as clouded tortoiseshell
plates in the Whieldon manner. One of the characteristics
of Castleford teapots with raised figures is
the use of a blue line at the edge and the tops of
these vessels depart from the straight lines of Turner
and are scalloped, as in the illustration (<a href="#Page_307">p. 307</a>) of
a Castleford black ware jug and cover, having the
impressed mark of the factory.</p>

<p><b>Rockingham.</b>&mdash;At Swinton, near Rotherham, as early
as 1778 a factory was started by Messrs. Thomas
Bingley &amp; Co., who began to manufacture cream
ware. The Leeds factory, apparently jealous of rivals,
as in the case of the Don Pottery, soon had an active
interest in this factory. In 1790 it became Greens,
Bingley &amp; Co., and the ware then made was blue
printed and the highly glazed black pottery associated
with Jackfield, of which we shall speak later. At
this time a brown glazed earthenware became widely
known and appreciated. It was cream ware which
had received a heavy lead glaze richly and warmly
coloured in brown. From 1796 to 1806 this glaze
became extensively used, not only by Swinton or, as
it afterwards came to be known, as "Rockingham,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
taking the name from the Marquis of Rockingham,
upon whose estate the works were situated.</p>

<p>This "Rockingham ware," of smooth surface and
fine reddish brown colour, was very popular, and a
teapot was made, known as the "Cadogan," which
was an imitation of the Chinese puzzle teapot. It
was made without a lid and was filled by turning it
upside down. An opening, very much in the manner
of the safety glass inkpot, admitted the tea, and on
reversing the vessel it could be poured out. Some
of these teapots are marked "Rockingham," or
"Brameld," or "Brameld &amp; Co.," and sometimes
"Mortlock," a London dealer for whom they were
made. In 1806 the Leeds interest passed out of the
firm, and the factory remained in the hands of John
and William Brameld. In 1826 it assumed the name
of the Rockingham Works, and used the crest of the
Fitzwilliam family. China was made there from 1820,
and the factory obtained considerable reputation and
was still in the hands of the Brameld family till the
close of the works in 1842. A gorgeous Rockingham
china dessert service made for William IV. costing
&pound;5,000.</p>

<p>We illustrate a "Cadogan" teapot, with its rich
brown glaze, and moulded in the form of a peach,
with smaller peaches applied at the top. It is a
remarkably un-English design, and it is singular that
it became so fashionable.</p>

<p><b>Jackfield.</b>&mdash;We mention Jackfield here, as it has
become among collectors quite a generic term for all
highly glazed black ware, especially little teapots and
cream jugs. It is certain that Elijah Mayer and
other Staffordshire potters largely made this ware,
and Bingley &amp; Co. (Swinton) among a crowd of
others. Jackfield is in Shropshire. Its history as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
pot works is as old as any in the country, but it
is chiefly in the period between 1760 and 1765, when
Maurice Thursfield carried on the little factory, that
it became renowned for its black ware. It is quite
unlike black basalt. It is red clay, covered with a
bright and highly lustrous black glaze. This is
ornamented with oil gilding, which in use has almost
disappeared. Some of the ware is decorated with
raised ornaments of vine leaves. The lids of teapots
often have a bird, with outstretched wings. The
designs were not original, and are found in salt-glaze
and in Whieldon ware, and some of this so-called
"Jackfield" ware may be attributed to him.</p>

<p><b>Newcastle and Sunderland.</b>&mdash;On the Tyne, the Wear,
and the Tees there were a group of potters working
at Gateshead, at Hylton, at Stockton-on-Tees, but
mainly at Newcastle and Sunderland. There is
nothing exceptionally artistic in any of these productions.
Some of these transfer-printed mugs were
made by Dixon &amp; Co., of Sunderland, to commemorate
the building of the Iron Bridge over the Wear, which
was begun in 1793 and completed in 1796.</p>

<p>Among the names found on this ware are impressed:
<span class="smcap">Sewell</span>, or <span class="smcap">Sewells &amp; Donkin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Sewells &amp; Co.</span>,
sometimes with the addition of <span class="smcap">St. Anthony's</span>.
These were made at St. Anthony's, near Newcastle,
in date about 1780 to 1790.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fell</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fell Newcastle</span>, made at St. Peter's,
Newcastle, about 1815.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scott</span>, or <span class="smcap">Scott Bros.</span>, made ware at Southwick,
Sunderland, 1789&ndash;1803, when they were succeeded by
<span class="smcap">Moore &amp; Co.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. Phillips, Hylton Pottery</span>, appears on some
Sunderland pieces. This firm was established as early
as 1765.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ford</span> is another name in connection with the
South Hylton works about 1800.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dixon, Austin &amp; Co.</span>, sometimes with the addition
of <span class="smcap">Sunderland</span>, is found at the beginning of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W. S. &amp; Co.</span>, with the word <span class="smcap">Wedgewood</span> (having
an additional "e") was the mark used by William
Smith &amp; Co., of Stockton-on-Tees, or even "<span class="smcap">Wedgwood
&amp; Co.</span>" Against this firm Messrs. Josiah
Wedgwood &amp; Sons, of Etruria, obtained in 1848 an
injunction to restrain the use of their name.</p>

<p>Another equally confusing mark to collectors is
that of a firm near Pontefract, who marked their
ware "Wedgwood &amp; Co." sometimes with the word
name of the factory, "Ferrybridge," and sometimes
"Tomlinson &amp; Co." Their ware is mainly cream
ware of an ordinary type.</p>

<p>In regard to the productions of Newcastle and
Sunderland these are best known by the familiar
mugs and jugs having a nautical flavour, with ships
in black transfer decoration, and never without
verses appropriate to the <i>client&egrave;le</i> of sailors, for whom
they were made. These mugs and jugs are frequently
decorated with pink lustre at the rims and in bands
around the body. A feature which associates these
northern factories with Leeds is the frequent use of a
modelled frog crawling up the inside of the vessel,
which was intended as a practical joke on the person
who was lifting the jug to his lips. These frog
mugs were previously made at Leeds, and the one
illustrated (<a href="#Page_303">p. 303</a>) has a frog so affixed in the
inside.</p>

<p>The ware, as a whole, is rather crude in its potting
and slightly inferior to similar Staffordshire ware,
but all these northern factories are now closed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the quaint doggerel, the queer nautical allusions,
and the strain of patriotism found on much of this
humble earthenware always appeal strongly to the
collector.</p>

<p>Before the year 1756, all ware, whether it be porcelain
or delft or earthenware, was painted, or, to follow
the term used in popular phraseology, it was "hand
painted." It is an essentially English art, and something
which stands with salt-glaze and with Wedgwood's
jasper ware as being famous throughout
Europe.</p>

<p>The subject of transfer-printing is surrounded with
a certain amount of conjecture in regard to its invention.
Quite a dozen persons were credited with having
originated it. Mr. William Turner, in his volume,
"Transfer Printing on Enamels, Porcelain, and
Pottery," published by Messrs. Chapman and Hall,
in 1907, has thoroughly investigated the various
claims set up for the discovery of transfer-printing
and, with no little research extending over a wide
area, has for the first time settled the relative position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of the various claimants and factories for which this
honour is claimed. It is impossible, covering the
same ground as Mr. William Turner, to say anything
new on transfer-printing, and we must express our
indebtedness to him in making use of his original
investigations and embodying them in this chapter
on transfer-printed ware.</p>

<p>In regard to over-glaze printing, including copper
enamels such as Battersea, porcelain such as Worcester,
and earthenware such as Liverpool delft&mdash;it
was at Battersea where enamels were first printed
in 1753; Liverpool, with Sadler and Green's invention,
comes second with printed delft tiles in 1756.
A year after, in 1757, we have Worcester with transfer-printed
porcelain. This Worcester printed ware is
well known from the early transfer-printed design
known as Hancock's "Tea party" and the "King
of Prussia" jugs and mugs.</p>

<p>After Worcester all the other porcelain factories
followed with transfer-printed ware. There was
Derby in 1764, and Caughley in the same year.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, so far as Liverpool is concerned
as representative of the earthenware factories
(cream ware being printed here to the order of the
Staffordshire potters), earthenware over-glaze printing
is slightly ahead of the porcelain factories. But
in under-glaze printing porcelain stands easily first.
Worcester commenced under-glaze printing in the
same year (1757) that over-glaze was employed
there, and Derby is the second in the field in
under-glaze printing in 1764.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a></span></p>

<p>It has already been shown that Liverpool did the
printing on the Staffordshire cream ware for the
potters who sent it there to be printed, and the
same method was followed by Leeds. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
came a time when it was no longer necessary to
ask Liverpool to employ a secret process for the
decoration of Staffordshire or Leeds work. The
secret known at Worcester, and Derby and Battersea,
was not many years a secret. The Staffordshire
potters undertook to do their own printing, and
every pottery soon learned the new process of transfer-printing,
and it was not long before improvements
were made and newer forms of printing adopted.</p>

<p><b>Its adoption in Staffordshire.</b>&mdash;Allusion has been
made to the awkward form of the square tile decoration
of fable subjects at Liverpool as applied to
circular plates. But Staffordshire in its adoption of
the new process made the transfer fit the object to
be decorated. In the illustration of the salt-glaze
Staffordshire plate with the black transfer-printed
design of "Hercules and the Waggoner" from <i>&AElig;sop's
Fables</i> (<a href="#Page_319">p. 319</a>), the engraver has departed from the
four corners of his circumscribed tile, and we may
put this piece down as of Staffordshire printing.</p>

<p>It is often largely a matter of conjecture as to
what was printed at Liverpool and what was printed
elsewhere (with the exception of Worcester, where
the engraving and printing were more delicate).</p>

<p>The Staffordshire jug showing a full-length portrait
of His Royal Highness Frederick, Duke of
York, having on the reverse the Dragoon in the
uniform of the period, tells its own story as
regards date. Frederick was the second son of
George III. and was born in 1763 and died in 1827.
As this portrait represents him as being advanced
into manhood and as at that date&mdash;say about 1786&mdash;the
Liverpool printers had been at work twenty
years, the transfer-printing may very reasonably be
attributed to Staffordshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is not always easy to fix the date of the
printing, and determine whether by that time Staffordshire
had embarked on its own transfer-printing in
black; of course, blue transfer-printing is later. The
difficulty usually arises in connection with black
transfer-printed ware. Liverpool was still engaged
in printing for Staffordshire potters as well as printing
cream ware of its own potting, and Leeds was
producing similar transfer-printed over-glaze ware, so
that in unmarked pieces there must always be an
uncertainty in coming to a definite conclusion. In
all probability the jug (illustrated <a href="#Page_323">p. 323</a>) and bearing
the inscription "Success to Trade" and having a
typical eighteenth century rural subject on the
reverse entitled "The Faithless Lover," was actually
printed by Sadler and Green at Liverpool.</p>

<p>Another finely decorated printed jug is that illustrated
(<a href="#Page_318">p. 318</a>), the subject representing <i>Diana</i> on
crescent moon driving a pair of goats in her chariot.
The date of this piece is about 1780 to 1800, and is
strongly suggestive of Wedgwood cream ware. It
will be observed that the design is identical with
that in the Turner jasper vase (illustrated <a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a></span></p>

<p><b>What is Transfer-printing?</b>&mdash;A piece of pottery may
be plain or undecorated, it may be painted, or it may
be printed. The process of printing consists of affixing
an engraved print from a copper plate and
transferring an impression to the pottery to be
decorated. It is this latter process which claims our
attention in this chapter. When transfer-printing
was first used, subjects such as portraits (King of
Prussia), costume subjects (series of actors and
actresses on Liverpool delft tiles), fancy or pastoral
scenes (such as <i>&AElig;sop's Fables</i>, &amp;c.), were produced in
black, puce, or reddish brown. These were at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
culled from contemporary volumes with engraved
copper-plate prints as illustrations. We find Wedgwood
in quite early days searching London for
suitable prints of views and similar small subjects for
decorative purposes. Probably at first the copper
plates which had been used in books were bought
up by the potters, and did service again for their
ware. Later they employed engravers, who no doubt
copied or adapted other people's engraved work to
suit their purpose, and as the art advanced it gained
in originality, and a band of engravers worked for
the potters in designing subjects strictly applicable to
the limitations in the technique of earthenware.</p>

<p>This process of transfer-printing is roughly as
follows. The copper-plate is inked, and a sheet of
tough tissue paper, wetted with a mixture of soap,
is applied to its surface and printed in a press. The
paper is taken off, showing an impression or print,
which is carefully laid on the surface of the piece
of earthenware to be decorated. The inked design
on the paper transfers itself to the earthenware.</p>

<p><b>Over-glaze Printing.</b>&mdash;The difference between over-glaze
and under-glaze decoration always seems to
puzzle the beginner, but the explanation is simple
enough. A piece of pottery is produced by the
following steps. The clay is "thrown," that is, it
is spun into shape on the potter's wheel, or it may be
made in a mould. When in this soft state, say in
the form of a basin, it could be crushed by the hand
into the shapeless mass of clay whence it sprung. It
is next put aside to dry sufficiently to allow handling.
It may receive some of its decoration at this stage as
it is possible to paint on the more or less damp clay,
but as a general rule that is left till the next stage.</p>

<p>It is now placed in the "biscuit" oven and receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the most intense heat, and is here stacked in fireproof
saggers or boxes to protect it from the flames, and it
is fired for about three days before being taken out in
the state known as "biscuit." Wedgwood's jasper
ware, black basalt, and all unglazed stoneware stop
at this biscuit or unglazed stage.</p>

<p>It is next dipped in liquid glaze and goes again to
be fired, this time into the "glost" or glaze oven,
which is lower in temperature. After coming from
this second oven it is no longer "biscuit" in appearance,
but is covered with a skin or coating of glass
or glaze, which has amalgamated with the body
underneath.</p>

<p>It is now ready for painting with enamel colours or
for transfer-printing, which obviously is "over-glaze"
decoration.</p>

<p>Lastly, after this decoration has been made, it goes
to be fired for a third time, and is put into the enamel
or "muffle" kiln, which is the lowest temperature of
the three.</p>

<p>In effect, then, the "over-glaze" decoration is on
top of everything, and obviously, when the piece is
scratched in use, this decoration wears away first.
This at once gives the reason for another process,
known as under-glaze decoration, where the work
receives the protection of the glaze.</p>

<p>As a postscript to this description of the three
firings, it may be noted in passing that, in true
porcelain, such as Chinese, Dresden, and Bristol (all
hard pastes), the body and glaze are fired at one
operation, the glaze receiving as high a temperature
as the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Under-glaze Printing.</b>&mdash;This is printing which is
transferred to the ware, either porcelain or earthenware,
when in its "biscuit" state <i>prior to being dipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in glaze</i>. Blue was the most frequent colour used in
under-glaze transfer-printing, as of course it was the
earliest colour used in the painted under-glaze decorations
at Worcester and Caughley. There are other
colours, obtained from metallic compounds, used both
on porcelain and earthenware under the glaze, and
owing to the temperature required for firing in this
manner the range is limited, being usually confined
to cobalt blue, green, brown, lilac, black, and a few
others. But blue is the chief under-glaze colour to
be considered in connection with under-glaze transfer-printing.
There was a great demand for deep blue
and for a lighter blue, both of which came to the
Staffordshire earthenware printers and potters from
English porcelain factories such as Caughley, where
Thomas Turner, an apprentice at Worcester under
Robert Hancock, made in 1780 his famous under-glaze
blue "Willow-pattern"; or the idea may have
been derived straight from the Chinese blue porcelain
under-glaze of Nankin, so much in vogue in middle
eighteenth-century days.</p>

<p><b>Staffordshire Transfer-printers.</b>&mdash;It has been shown
how the Staffordshire potters at first turned to Liverpool,
and readily sought the aid of Sadler and Green
in the decoration of their salt-glaze and their cream
ware, in order to compete with the porcelain factories
with Worcester and Caughley at their head. But
trade secrets found their way into Staffordshire. The
over-glaze printing as practised by Sadler and Green
was soon mastered, and later the under-glaze blue
printing was imported by workmen from Caughley.</p>

<p>Among the Staffordshire potters the following are
the principal pioneers in regard to transfer-printing
in its various developments. William Adams, of
Cobridge, in 1775 first introduced transfer-printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
into Staffordshire. John Turner, of Lane End (not
to be confounded with Thomas Turner, of Caughley)
was the first to print under-glaze blue in Staffordshire.
Josiah Spode, about 1784, introduced his
under-glaze blue "willow pattern," a copy of the
Caughley pattern. William Adams, of Greengates,
in 1787 brought out his under-glaze blue, which in
richness and mellowness has never been surpassed;
and Josiah Wedgwood, although he never deserted
Liverpool for some of his patterns, had a press at
work at Etruria, in 1787; and Thomas Minton, now a
master potter at Stoke, formerly an apprentice at
Caughley with Thomas Turner, designed the celebrated
"Broseley Dragon" pattern tea service for porcelain
in 1782 (following the willow pattern, 1780), and
produced in the late years of the eighteenth century,
about 1793, some fine blue-printed ware at Stoke.</p>

<p>These may be termed the earlier exponents of
transfer-printing in Staffordshire, but there were
others whose blue-printed ware was of great merit
in Staffordshire, and Leeds and Swansea, held no
insignificant place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Other Transfer Printers.</b>&mdash;Staffordshire did not long
have the monopoly of under-glaze blue-printed ware.
Leeds and Swansea both produced similar work, and
in both cases there is a strong attachment to Oriental
design. Black transfer-printing was also executed at
both these factories, and at Swansea some exceptionally
fine engraved work was turned out (see illustration
of Swansea plate, <a href="#Page_397">p. 397</a>). At Sunderland and
Newcastle the black transfer-printed mugs and jugs
with the <i>Wear Bridge</i> and with nautical subjects
became quite the vogue, and in these two factories
the jugs and mugs often had a frog modelled in the
interior, and pink lustre decoration was used in combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
with the transfer design usually at the
borders or at the rims.</p>

<p><b>The Mission of Black-printed Ware.</b>&mdash;In the designs
and inscriptions of the black transfer-printed ware the
Staffordshire potter used his jugs and his mugs as a
medium to record events and to ventilate grievances,
not in "imperishable verse," but in the fickle body of
the clay. This class of ware from 1760 to 1860
stands for a century as typically English in character.
It reflects the political, social, and religious events,
and in matter-of-fact, humorous, or satirical fashion.
The black transfer-printed or earlier period, (though
some of this class come down as late as the railway
mugs of 1830), may be said to depict events and
chronicle popular sentiment in black and white.
The blue transfer-printer strove to be decorative,
and mainly represented scenery and topography, and
much of it was bound down to formal designs of
Oriental nature.</p>

<p>At first fable subjects, as on Wedgwood's cream
ware, were employed, and it has been seen how the
square tile form was discarded by the engraver who
made his engraving fit the object to be decorated.
This perfect mastery of the technique of transfer-printing
is shown very clearly in the old blue Spode
service of the "Tower" pattern (illustrated, <a href="#Page_335">p. 335</a>).
It will be seen how, as the shape of each vessel
differed, the engraver has altered his bridge to fit the
new circumstances. At one time, on a broad, flat
dish, it appears as a wide bridge, and in the circular
plate the trees appear at greater height and the
viaduct assumes a more circular form. In the jug
of the same design the bridge is narrow, as though
spanning a deep ravine.</p>

<p>To enumerate the classes of ware with black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
transfer-printing is to make a catalogue of the
principal events which stirred the heart of the
people. It must be borne in mind that this school
was working side by side with the makers of fine
stoneware and of jasper ware with classic subjects,
but it is, after all, to the black-printed ware that
one turns most lovingly as being more human.</p>

<p>It will suffice, perhaps, if we quote a few examples
and stir the enthusiasm of the reader to pursue the
collection of these really historic records which have
something more endearing in them than the relics
of Napoleon or the shoestrings of some of the Stuart
monarchs.</p>

<p>There is a fine flavour of patriotism, of conviviality,
and of homely sentiment in some of the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>On a bowl, salt-glazed ware, with Admiral Vernon
and his fleet is inscribed "The British Glory revived
by Admiral Vernon. He took Porto Bello with Six
Ships only. Nov. ye 22 1739." A cream-ware jug
printed, with medallion portrait of Earl Howe, is
inscribed "<span class="smcap">Long Live Earl Howe</span>, Commander-in-Chief
of the Victorious <span class="smcap">British Fleet</span>. In the
ever memorable engagement on the Glorious First
of June, 1794." On a cream-ware jug about 1800
with a view of Greenwich Hospital, and entitled
"The Sailor's Adieu," the following lines are inscribed:
"What should tear me from the arms of my Dearest
Polly but the undeniable calls of my country in
whose cause I have engag'd my Honour and my
Life." This in date is the last year of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>"The Sailor's Farewell and Return" are rather
frequent, and Charles Dibdin's verses appear on
some of these jugs and mugs. There is one interesting
jug in the form of a sailor seated on a chest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
coloured earthenware about 1770, with a breezy
inscription, "Hullo, Brother Briton, whoever Thou
be, Sit down on that chest of Hard Dollars by me,
and drink a health to all sailors bold."</p>

<p>Another cream-ware jug, partly printed and
touched by colour representing a man-of-war towing
a frigate, has the inscription:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"A sailor's life's a pleasant life;</div>
<div class="i2">He freely roams from shore to shore,</div>
<div class="i0">In every port he finds a wife,</div>
<div class="i2">What can a sailor wish for more?"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A red earthenware mug with white slip may be
mentioned here as having a characteristic motto:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"From rocks and sands and barren lands</div>
<div class="i2">Good Fortune sets me free;</div>
<div class="i0">And from great Guns and Women's tongues,</div>
<div class="i2">Good Lord, deliver me."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A Staffordshire blue-printed jug, made in 1793,
shows the execution of Louis XVI. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century there was quite a
burst of Napoleonic jugs and mugs and busts, and
some of Gillray's caricatures find themselves on
earthenware. There is one lustre earthenware jug
printed and coloured with caricatures entitled "Jack
Frost attacking 'Bony' in Russia" and "Little
'Bony' sneaking into Paris with a white feather in
his tail." This is in date about 1813.</p>

<p>A cover of an earthenware jar has the inscription
printed in violet within a wreath, "Peace! May its
duration equal the years of War."</p>

<p>The relations between England and America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
received attention at the Staffordshire potters' hands.
There are cream-ware mugs and jugs and plates with
portraits of Washington in date from 1785 to 1790.
On one the inscription runs, "Success to the United
States, America."</p>

<p>Prize-fighting, bear-baiting, cock-fighting, racing,
coaching, all received their records on the earthenware
of the late eighteenth century. Stag hunting,
fox hunting, coursing, come as ready subjects to the
transfer-printer. Cricket is recorded in earthenware
on a printed mug representing the "Grand Cricket
Match played in Lord's Ground, Mary-le-bone,
June 20 and following day between the Earls of
Winchester and Darnley for 1,000 guineas." The
date of this is 1790. Even the velocipede and the
balloon are not disregarded.</p>

<p>This list is but a rough outline of the mission of
the transfer-printer in recording current events on
his earthenware, for the pleasure of his own contemporaries
and for the information and delectation of
succeeding generations of collectors who may be
something other than connoisseurs of pastes and
bodies, and have learned to read aright the story
of the china-shelf and enjoy to the full the secret
pleasures in the byeways of collecting.</p>

<p><b>Types of Blue-printed Ware.</b>&mdash;The black over-glaze
transfer-printing came into Staffordshire in imitation
of the transfer-printed delft tiles of Liverpool. But
it rapidly acquired a strength and originality of its
own. It lacked the delicacy of the transfer-printed
black porcelain of Worcester, but its virility more
than made up for its artistic defects.</p>

<p>Under-glaze blue-printed ware was an imitation
from the porcelain printed at Caughley. Here again
it may be said to have outstripped by new departures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and broader effects the under-glaze blue-printing of
the early china factories. In common with them its
inspiration was from the Chinese. We illustrate
(<a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>) four examples of Chinese porcelain plates,
which are types of the Oriental china designs which
served as models both for the English porcelain
makers and for the earthenware of Staffordshire.</p>

<p>The lower left-hand plate is evidently the Chinese
design from which the English potters derived the
well-known and favourite "willow pattern." After
Thomas Turner, of Caughley, had printed it on
china in 1780, and Josiah Spode in 1784 had employed
it on his earthenware in Staffordshire, all the
other potters commenced to make the same design
with slightly different details, mainly in the fret
border. The other plate on the right hand is the well-known
"aster" pattern, so frequently adopted by
English potters in blue-printed cream ware. The
two upper octagonal plates show the two styles of
dark blue and light blue under-glaze painting employed
by the Chinese; and the Staffordshire potter,
true to his models, followed in his under-glaze blue-printing
these tones. The period when the rich
deep dark-blue-printed ware was in vogue is from the
early nineteenth century to about 1825. Light blue
printing was employed from 1790 till the deep blue
supplanted it, and when the craze for deep blue had
spent itself the light blue again became fashionable
until printing in colour in the middle period of the
nineteenth century came to be largely practised.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the border in the Oriental
example we illustrate, it will be noticed how Josiah
Spode and others, including the fine school at Leeds,
who were printing in under-glaze blue in 1790, and
the potters at Swansea, followed this decorative treatment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Spode in particular had a great fondness for
Chinese subjects. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_345">p. 345</a>) a blue-printed
dish by him, where, as was his wont, he
introduced, quite incongruously, a Gothic castle. The
fine, rich colouring of this dish is most noticeable.</p>

<p>In the Spode earthenware <i>Jug</i> and <i>Plate</i> illustrated
(<a href="#Page_331">p. 331</a>), it will be seen that the plate, known as the
"Bridge" pattern, closely follows the design of the
Chinese porcelain plate (<a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>), and the jug is
decorated with the familiar "Willow" pattern.
Another variation of the "Willow" design is found
on the <i>Turner Cream-ware Dish</i>, illustrated, having
a band of embossed wickerwork and a pierced border.
This piece has the impressed mark <span class="smcap">Turner</span>.</p>

<p>A similar Oriental influence is seen in the dark
blue transfer-printed dish by William Adams, of
Greengates (see illustration, <a href="#Page_341">p. 341</a>). The inclination
here is towards figure subjects, and the decorative
use of the exotic bird, as shown in the centre panel
of this dish, finds a place on some of Mason's early
blue-printed dishes. Of the colour of the dishes of
William Adams, of Greengates, it may be remarked
that for richness of tone in the under-glaze blue he
introduced in 1787 they have never been surpassed.</p>

<p><b>What is the Willow pattern?</b>&mdash;The name "willow-pattern"
has been so frequently mentioned in connection
with the subject of old English earthenware
and china that it will be of service to state something
of the details of the history of this particular pattern,
which seems to have unaccountably seized hold of
popular imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a></span></p>

<p>The Caughley pattern, which some authorities
believe was engraved by Minton when he was an
apprentice there, was closely followed by Spode,
Adams, Wedgwood, Davenport, Clews, Leeds, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Don Pottery, and Swansea. The differences are
slight mainly in the treatment of the fretted border,
either a lattice-work or conventional butterfly being
used, and details of the fence in the foreground
differing.</p>

<p>The term "Willow" is applied in a general way to
many of the copies of the blue-and-white Oriental
porcelain imported from China during the last half
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>But the "willow pattern," to which a story is
attached, is of the same design as the Chinese plate
illustrated (<a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>), which Caughley copied. This
popular adaptation appears as a decoration on the
covers of this volume.</p>

<p>Whether the story was invented by some ingenious
person to fit the plate we do not know; but there is
strong probability that this is so. On Chinese plates
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> are missing. The willow has
ever been a sad tree, whereof such as have lost their
love make their mourning garlands. "I offered him
my company to a willow-tree ... to make him a
garland, as being forsaken," says Benedick in <i>Much
Ado about Nothing</i>.</p>

<p>This is the love-story that is told concerning the
"willow" plate. Chang, the secretary of a mandarin
whose house is on the right of the plate, dared to
love his master's daughter, Li-chi. But the mandarin
had other designs, and his daughter was
promised to an old but wealthy suitor. In order to
prevent the lovers from meeting, the mandarin imprisoned
his daughter in a room in his house overlooking
the water. A correspondence ensued, so
the story goes, between the lovers, and the lady sent
a poetical message, in a cocoa-nut shell, floating
down the river, that she expected Chang when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
willow-leaf commenced to fall. By the connivance
of a gardener, who apparently lived in the small
cottage on the left, overshadowed by a fir-tree, the
lovers escaped, and are depicted as fleeing over the
bridge&mdash;the mandarin behind with a whip in his
hand, the lady in front, and Chang in the middle
carrying her jewel-box! The individual in the junk,
higher up, is intended to denote that they fled to
the island in the north-west of the plate. They lived
happy until Fate, in the shape of the wealthy lover,
overtook them and burned their house to ashes. But
the gods changed them into two doves, which, of
course, figure prominently in the design.</p>

<p>This tragic story of disastrous love has clung to
the willow-pattern plates, and nobody can shake the
belief of owners of indifferent specimens of middle-nineteenth
century days that these plates are of great
value. As a matter of fact, apart from the eighteenth-century
examples, anything else is not worth the
attention of the serious collector.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the historic character of the
black transfer-printed ware, but sometimes similar
subjects were attempted in the blue ware. We
illustrate a dish known as the "Chesapeake and
Shannon" dish, depicting the famous naval encounter
between these two vessels.</p>

<p>At a time when the school of landscape engravers
dearly loved a classic ruin or the broken arch of a
temple in the composition of the scene, it is only
natural to find this class of subject on the printed
ware. We illustrate a typical under-glaze blue-printed
dish with fine contrasts showing very accurately
what excellent decoration was employed in
this engraved work. The school of Claude landscapes
found its votaries, and some strong engraving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
by Brookes and others was done for this old blue
earthenware. It is pictorial, and betrays an attempt
to break new ground and get away from the conventions
of Oriental design, but the border in the
dish we illustrate (<a href="#Page_345">p. 345</a>) shows the strong Japanese
spirit which had inspired Spode, and this touch of
incongruity makes it more than probable that this
dish is of Spode origin.</p>

<p>There are many other phases of printed ware that
can only be alluded to in passing. The transfer
printing in outline, the colour being added by hand,
was the beginning of the establishment of all the
modern methods for china and earthenware as
commonly in use. Something, too, should be said
of "bat" printing. This was the use of a block of
glue instead of transfer-paper to receive the inked
impression from the copper plate and transfer it to
the body of the earthenware. William Adams, of
Cobridge, in 1775 first introduced "bat" printing
into Staffordshire. Of the various types of engraving,
such as line, and stipple, and aquatint, and, later,
lithography, there is no space to deal. But enough
has been said in connection with the various types of
printed ware to show that when pursued in a special
manner it may be found to be of exceptional interest
to the collector.</p>

Transfer-printed Earthenware.</p>

<p>Many printed examples are unmarked, both of the
early transfer-printing in black over the glaze, and
of the latter under-glaze blue-printed ware, but over
a wide period the following names are found as marks
upon various transfer-printed specimens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<span class="f75">STAFFORDSHIRE FIGURES</span></p>

<p class="chapblock">Early Period (1675&ndash;1725): Slip, Agate, and Astbury
Figures&mdash;Best Period (1725&ndash;1760): Fine Modelling
and Reticent Colouring, Ralph Wood the elder,
Aaron Wood, Thomas Wheildon&mdash;Classic Period
(1760&ndash;1785): Wedgwood, Neale, Voyez, Ralph Wood,
junior, Enoch Wood, Lakin and Poole&mdash;Decadent
Period (1785&ndash;1830): Walton, Scott, Bott, Lockett,
Dale, and imitative school.</p>


<p>In attempting to classify the great array of Staffordshire
figures and groups, extending over a period of
a century and a half, no little difficulty has been
experienced. The number of unmarked specimens is
very great, and in many cases, owing to trade rivalry,
models were so extensively imitated that it is
impossible to say who was the first modeller. These
Staffordshire figures, except in the instances of the
highest modelling and restrained under-glaze colouring
of the best period, cannot be regarded as ceramic
triumphs. But they are highly valuable, although not
from an artistic point of view, as illustrative of the
character of the common folk in England, and exemplifying
their tastes and their sentiments.</p>

<p>Ornament, even in the humblest articles of daily use,
has its meaning and can tell its story, to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
read aright, of the feeling of the man who produced
it; whether he took a pleasure in making the article,
or whether he was a machine, human or other, producing
only a thin echo of art. Practically it may be
asserted that from middle eighteenth-century days to
middle nineteenth-century days ceramic art was
steadily deteriorating. Applied art had practically
ceased to exist in the early nineteenth century. It is
said that men's eyes were first opened to this fact by
the cumulative hideousness of the Great Exhibition of
1851, and certainly a perusal of the illustrated catalogue
of that Exhibition is a saddening occupation.</p>

<p>In the study of the china shelf this decadence must
always be considered, and it is fully borne out by
a close study of the subject of Staffordshire figures.
Practically, the crude agate cat and the little mannikin
of early days playing bagpipes found replicas in
crudity and poverty of invention in the spotted poodle
dog or the kilted Scotsman, the common cottage
ornaments of a century later. And between these
two dates, with the exception of an outburst which
promised to develop into something really great and
almost did so, there was, owing to want of artistic
instinct and general lack of culture, a fairly rapid
degeneration into the hideous nightmare of the Toby
jug and all the awful insularities of the late Staffordshire
period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Early Period</b> (1675&ndash;1725).&mdash;The method of slip
decoration has already been described, and to this
period, when Toft and his school had implanted their
quaint and original taste upon the common people,
these early figures belong. Among the best-known
figures of this early date are small <i>Cats</i> of stoneware
or earthenware body, coated with white and ornamented
with spots in brown slip. <i>Ducks</i> are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
found similarly ornamented in spots and wavy
lines. These figures are only 3 inches in height. To
these days belong the solid agate <i>Cats</i> made of two
or three clays of different colours intermingled, and
highly glazed. These are some 5 or 6 inches in height.
We give an illustration of this type of ware (<a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>).
<i>Bears</i> in agate ware the same nature, and small
figures of doll-like individuals are also found.</p>

<p>The elder Astbury (1736&ndash;1743) has been credited
with a series of figures of men, some 6 inches in
height, playing bagpipes or other instruments. They
are splashed with green and brown, and have yellow
slip ornament, their lead glazing is warm and rich.
The beady eyes of some of these tiny figures is
suggestive of the Toft slip applied figure on some
of his dishes, and was produced by the use of
manganese.</p>

<p>Among early figures those of salt-glaze are rare
and of exceptional interest, and the figure illustrated
(<a href="#Page_351">p. 351</a>), stands as a typical example of a class not
frequently met with, and highly prized by collectors.</p>

<p>We have seen in the chapter dealing with Whieldon
and his influence that he commenced potting before
1740 and continued till 1780, and although none of
his figures is marked it is tolerably certain that he
produced some fine work in which he introduced the
beautiful tortoiseshell glazings, which characteristic
is found on figures attributed to him. Obviously
over a period of nearly half a century Whieldon ware
varies in quality. The following class of figures may
be attributed to the early Whieldon period, that is,
before 1760. <i>Actor</i>, with turban and flowing mantle,
hand resting on dagger; tortoiseshell ware, brown
and green glazing; height, 5&frac12; inches. <i>Diana</i>, with
dog, on square hollow pedestal made of buff clay;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
brown and grey glazings, eyes of brown clay; height,
7 inches. <i>Venus</i>, with bow, on irregular base, eyes
brown clay; height, 5&frac12; inches. Figure of <i>Sphinx</i>,
coloured with brown and green glazings; height,
3&frac12; inches. <i>Monkey</i>, eyes, black; height, 4 inches.
Other animals, such as <i>Lion</i>, height, 3&frac14; inches;
<i>Squirrel</i>, height, 7 inches; <i>Cock</i>, height, 7&frac14; inches;
<i>Cow</i>, in form of small jug with woman milking,
height, 5&frac12; inches; <i>Dog</i>, with brown glazing, height,
3&frac34; inches. Other figures of this early period are
<i>Summer</i> and <i>Winter</i>, each 4&frac12; inches high; sauceboats
in form of <i>Duck</i> and <i>Drake</i>, coloured glazings, height,
4&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>(We have illustrated several types of these figures,
<a href="#Page_171">pp. 171, 175</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Best Period</b> (1735&ndash;1760).&mdash;This is known to
collectors as the Wood School. Briefly, the history
of the Wood family is as follows, and will be of
interest to collectors of Staffordshire figures. So
strong and original is the work of the modeller Ralph
Wood the elder, that connoisseurs recognise the class
of face in his work. Aaron Wood and Ralph Wood
were the sons of the old Ralph Wood, a miller.
They were both modellers of distinction. Aaron is
mainly known as a block-cutter of salt-glaze moulds.
Ralph Wood (1750&ndash;1772) made figures and other
rustic groups at his own factory at Burslem. His
models are straightforward and homely and strongly
English, not greatly influenced by any extraneous
classic models. He modelled the celebrated "Vicar
and Moses," which for quaint humour is inimitable.
It has been copied by all the potters, and much of its
strength and simplicity of modelling has been lost,
while its restraint in colouring disappeared in the
copies upon which enamel colours were lavishly laid.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a></span></p>


<p>There was a strong Quaker element in Staffordshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
and the Established Church was the subject of
a good deal of satire by the potter. The <i>Parson and
Clerk</i> returning home after a carousal, <i>The Tithe Pig</i>
and other subjects exemplify this. Fielding published
"Joseph Andrews" in 1742, and it appears that
parson-baiting was a familiar form of amusement.
Probably there were a good many abuses in the
Church that were evident. The hunting parson was
often the boon companion of the drinking squire. At
any rate the Ralph Wood group, entitled <i>The Vicar
and Moses</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> showing the sleeping vicar, with full-bottomed
wig, and Moses, the clerk, seated underneath
the pulpit exhorting the congregation with
uplifted hand, is a masterly piece of modelling. In
colour the original Ralph Wood examples are light
purplish throbbing brown in the pulpit and desk, and
carved cherubs, green in the canopy behind the vicar,
and who has a white cassock, and the coat of Moses
is a slatey blue. The flesh tints are low in tone.</p>

<p>To return to Aaron Wood, the brother of Ralph
Wood, he was the father of William Wood, who
became one of Wedgwood's modellers, and of Enoch
Wood, who went to Palmer as modeller for some
years. In 1784 Enoch Wood commenced business
for himself. He produced cream ware and black
basalt and, what most interests us here, he made some
excellent figures, including a bust of <i>John Wesley</i>. In
1790 he entered into partnership with James Caldwell.
The ware is marked "Wood and Caldwell" till 1818,
when the firm became "Enoch Wood and Sons," till
1866.</p>

<p>In regard to Ralph Wood, the elder, he appears to
have engaged his son in his pottery, so that prior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
his death, in 1772, we do not know which Ralph Wood
modelled some of the figures; but from 1772 to 1797
Ralph Wood, junior, was responsible for the factory,
and there seems to have been business connection,
about 1786, between him and his cousin Enoch Wood.</p>

<p>Concerning the figures of Ralph Wood, father
and son, it may be said that they were the first to
impress their names upon Staffordshire figures.
Some of the pieces are marked with impressed mark
<span class="smcap">R. Wood</span>, <span class="smcap">Ra Wood</span>, <span class="smcap">Burslem</span> (impressed on <i>Vicar
and Moses</i>). This mark is found on some of the finest
and earliest Toby jugs. It is believed, though not
proved, that "<span class="smcap">Ra Wood</span>" is the mark adopted by
Ralph Wood, junior.</p>

<p>That the Woods reflected English feeling and
sentiment and did not go to the classics for their
inspiration is shown by their fine model of <i>Hudibras</i>
upon his horse, in the act of drawing his sword.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i0">And ate into itself, for lack</div>
<div class="i0">Of some body to hew and hack."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The horse of Hudibras is as famed in story as
<i>Rosinante</i>, the famous charger of Don Quixote, and
in fine satire Butler enumerates his points.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a></span></p>

<p>It is not too much to aver that, if it were not known
that the Wood model bore the title <i>Hudibras</i>, the
source of inspiration would go unknown. Similarly
it may not be impossible, since no title appears on the
famous <i>Toby Philpot</i> jug, that it may be derived from
the character of <i>Uncle Toby</i> in Sterne's "Tristram
Shandy," which was published in nine volumes from
1759 to 1767. The type of blunt, jovial, rubicund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
Englishman was beginning to become as pronounced
in Bunbury and other caricaturists as it became later
on the china shelf.</p>

<p>Among other noticeable figures of the Ralph Wood
period the pair of figures are the <i>Haymakers</i>, separate
figures (7&frac12; inches high each, impressed <span class="smcap">R. Wood</span>), a
youth and maiden leaning against tree trunks. A
bust of <i>Milton</i>, cream ware, uncoloured, is impressed
<span class="smcap">Ra. Wood, Burslem</span>; height, 9 inches. <i>Old Age</i> is
represented by a rustic figure of an old man leaning
upon a stick and a crutch. <i>Neptune</i> and <i>Venus</i> and
<i>Apollo</i> betray the contemporary classic influence.</p>

<p>In examining the figures of the elder Ralph
Wood they will be found in parts, though hardly
perceptible, to be unglazed. This is owing to the fact
that he applied his glaze with a brush. In the figures
of the best period the colouring is extremely delicate,
and the flesh tints do not approach the rosy pink
associated with other figure work. It is difficult to
describe them, but they approximate to a biscuit-coloured
grey. But there are the usual exceptions to
all rules. In one case in particular the colouring is
more pronounced&mdash;the bust of <i>Handel</i>, who died in
1759. It is marked "<span class="smcap">Ra. Wood.</span>" It is finely
modelled and bright in colouring. A figure of a
<i>Cock</i>, marked <span class="smcap">R. Wood</span>, is illustrated (<a href="#Page_351">p. 351</a>). It is
8 inches in height. The body is light in colour, with
light and dark brown decoration about the neck.
The wings are yellow, with brown stripes, the tail
brown and dark-blue enamel colours. Legs dark
brown and green and splashed base. This specimen
is in one piece, not having any joint at neck.</p>

<p>The fine coloured large figure (18 inches in height)
of <i>Eloquence</i>, known also as <i>St. Paul preaching at
Athens</i>, is by Enoch Wood, after a model by Sir H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Cheere. There is a similar figure in the Schreiber
Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum. But
it must be admitted that some of these large figures
bear a strong resemblance in technique and modelling
to those of Wedgwood. The <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i>
group was most certainly reproduced by Enoch
Wood, who signed it. So that the difficulty in such
cases of determining which was the original model
becomes very great.</p>

<p><b>The Classic Period</b> (1760&ndash;1785).&mdash;It appears that
Josiah Wedgwood, when under the influence of
Whieldon and before he embarked upon his classic
ornamentation under the guidance of Bentley,
modelled some very fine figures which are unmarked,
but exhibit considerable strength and beauty. There
are three figures, <i>Faith</i>, <i>Hope</i>, and <i>Charity</i>, in date
about 1770, in the Willett Collection marked Wedgwood.
Other figures are the large ones of <i>Fortitude</i>
and <i>Prudence</i> (height 21 inches). But these symbolistic
figures betray the classic influence. They are
magnificent pieces of modelling. Then there is
the fine group of <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i>, the same
height. The specimen at the British Museum is
cream colour, but later imitators adopted the same
modelling and added colour to the decoration. A
copy of this group so treated, possibly by Enoch

<p><b>Neale &amp; Co.</b> betray classic influence in much of
their work, and as Voyez, the Frenchman, was their
modeller, this is not hard to understand. Among
their well-known figures are <i>Flora</i> (12&frac12; inches high)
and <i>Diana</i> (5 inches high), and they were large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
makers of Toby jugs. We give an illustration (<a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>)
of a group of finely modelled ware by Neale &amp; Co.,
including a Toby jug copied from the Ralph Wood
model and impressed <span class="smcap">Naele &amp; Co.</span>, and the familiar
group of the <i>Parson and Clerk</i> copied by them after
the well-known Chelsea-Derby porcelain model of the
same subject, and reproduced as an earthenware
group by many other Staffordshire potters. It is often
attributed to Ralph Wood the younger. It is interesting
to compare the <i>Minerva</i> with the <i>Diana</i>
illustrated above. The same classic spirit was the
inspiration of the two modellers, and in the case of
unmarked classic figures there always exists considerable
difficulty in definitely assigning their origin.</p>

<p>In regard to all these coloured Staffordshire figures
it should be borne in mind that, until well towards the
close of the eighteenth century, they were coloured
by the use of pigments under the glaze, which gave
a low-toned effect of very delicate character. Later,
enamel colours were used with lurid effect, and much
of the beauty of the old school vanished.</p>

<p><b>Enoch Wood</b> (1783&ndash;1840), <b>Wood and Caldwell</b> (1790&ndash;1818).&mdash;Of
this school there are several fine examples.
There is no doubt that the ease with which
classic prototypes could be copied and porcelain
figures imitated began to tell upon the originality of
most of the modellers. The <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i>
(illustrated <a href="#Page_363">p. 363</a>), with the vine leaf wreaths in green
around the heads and the finely coloured drapery, is
by Enoch Wood. There is a specimen in a private
collection at Eccles signed "<span class="smcap">E. Wood</span>, Sculp. and
<span class="smcap">Hewitt</span> Pinxt." (the height of this example is 27
inches), in spite of the similar uncoloured group at the
British Museum marked Wedgwood.</p>

<p>Enoch Wood is best known for his portrait busts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
of <i>John Wesley</i> and of <i>George Whitfield</i>. The former
who stayed at his house in the Potteries sat for this
bust, which is a fine piece of portraiture. This is
marked "<span class="smcap">E. Wood</span>," and sometimes "<span class="smcap">Enoch Wood</span>,
Sculp., Burslem 1781." George Whitfield was probably
modelled at a later date. There is a fine equestrian
statuette of <i>St. George and the Dragon</i>, sometimes
signed "E. Wood," similar in modelling to the
Whieldon mottled tortoiseshell coloured specimen
(illustrated <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>).</p>

<p>There are other busts by Enoch Wood which are
noteworthy. There is the fine bust of <i>Bonaparte</i> as
First Consul in coloured earthenware, with blue coat
with yellow border, and having marbled base. The
height of this is 9&frac12; inches, and it is marked "<span class="smcap">E.
Wood</span>." This is in date about 1802. A bust of
<i>Alexander I.</i> of Russia, in highly coloured earthenware,
in military costume, marked <span class="smcap">Wood &amp; Caldwell</span>.
The date of this is later than the Bonaparte,
an inscription on the back on some examples runs
"Alexander Aet. 35. Moscow burnt. Europe preserved
1812."</p>

<p>Another well-known figure by Wood and Caldwell
is the figure of Quin as <i>Falstaff</i>. By the illustrations
we have given (<a href="#Page_371">p. 371</a>) it will be seen that this model
was in direct imitation of the similar figures in porcelain
at Derby and Chelsea. The colouring is different,
the shield is silver lustre, the costume consists of
red breeches, striped yellow and white surtout; but
these colours are a feeble imitation of the finer
enamel work on the china models from which they
have been copied.</p>

<div class="i0">Defamed by every charlatan,</div>
<div class="i0">And soil'd with all ignoble use.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That it was not infrequent to take a model bodily
from English porcelain is shown by the group entitled
the <i>Birth of Venus</i>, which is taken from a
Plymouth group of the same subject (illustrated
<a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>), this apparently belongs to the Enoch Wood
period.</p>

<p>In the figures of children we illustrate <a href="#Page_387">p. 387</a>, the
figures of <i>Flower Boys</i>, some 4&frac12; inches high, are
evidently inspired by some of the Chelsea-Derby
figures which in their turn were under strong French
influence. The middle figure of the trio is one of
a pair by Wood and Caldwell. The figure of <i>Cupid</i>
above is a fine specimen, standing 17&frac12; inches in
height. Cupid is fully armed with his deadly bow
and arrow, which by the way are decorated in silver
lustre, suggestive of the Falstaff shield of Wood and
Caldwell, and at his feet are two lions crouching in
subjugation, and he holds the torch of Hymen in his
hand. This is a remarkably fine modelled figure
representing this contemporary foreign influence upon
Staffordshire figures at its best.</p>

<p>In regard to the strong classic influence the two
figures (illustrated <a href="#Page_363">p. 363</a>) are in white earthenware.
That on the left, of <i>Adonis</i>, is obviously taken direct
from the antique, while the <i>Venus</i> is a fine Staffordshire
adaptation of a well-known classic statue in
the pose and in the dolphin by her side. The only
touch of colour is the darkening of the hair. It is
a magnificent piece of modelling something in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
nature of the classic art seen through French eyes.
To find this in Staffordshire is as though one found
<i>La Source</i> of Ingres in the Royal Academy of the
year 1856. The date of this Staffordshire <i>Venus</i>
cannot be stated. It is an important figure, being
24 inches in height and exhibits something so strikingly
realistic that it must be assigned a high place
among the figures.</p>

<p>We illustrate a Staffordshire figure belonging to
this period, which is signed "Absalon, Yarmouth."
Towards the end of the eighteenth century, as in the
latter days of Lowestoft, a factory termed "The Ovens"
at Yarmouth carried on a decorating business, receiving
the ware from Leeds and from Staffordshire, and
decorating and refiring it in the glost oven. The
date of the figure illustrated is about 1790. On
some of the pieces decorated by Absalon, the name
of the Staffordshire maker, Turner, appears as an
impressed mark. Turner, who carried on an extensive
trade with the Baltic and Northern Europe, no
doubt readily came into touch with these East
Anglian decorators.</p>

<p><b>The Decadent Period</b> (1785&ndash;1830).&mdash;It is impossible
to keep exactly to dates in any of these periods of
rough classification. But in general the later period
becomes more homely and a great number of mantel
ornaments of a simple nature with rustic subjects
were made for the homes of cottagers. These have
trees as background and are Arcadian in subject.
They are, when in this style, of the finnicking school
of the Chelsea shepherds and shepherdesses known
as of the boscage school. John Walton (1790&ndash;1839),
made a great many figures in this manner, accompanied
by a lamb, as well as a great number of Toby
jugs. Another potter is Ralph Salt (1812&ndash;1840),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
whose name appears on the little <i>Tambourine Player</i>
(<a href="#Page_379">p. 379</a>), and probably the <i>Musicians</i> of the adjacent
group are by him too. A larger figure of the <i>Girl
with Tambourine</i> above is of the same period, though
its maker cannot be identified.</p>

<p>We illustrate (<a href="#Page_391">p. 391</a>) two later figures, <i>The Fishwife</i>
and <i>Mother Goose</i>. Both are well modelled, and
were evidently intended to meet the popular taste.
The days of gods and goddesses were over, and
figures and groups begin to grow commonplace. In
<i>Mother Goose</i> the nursery rhyme is substituted for
the mythology of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Among other names found on these later figures
are Lakin and Poole, Dale (mark usually impressed
<span class="smcap">I. Dale Burslem</span>), and Edge and Grocott, who
made figures of boys partly draped holding baskets
of flowers. It is possible that they made the two
outside figures of <i>Flower Boys</i> (illustrated <a href="#Page_387">p. 387</a>).</p>

<p>There is to lovers of the ultra-aesthetic something
which appears to be trivial and insipid in this peasant
pottery of the later date. But in spite of its defects,
it holds, to those who read between the lines and can
add that necessary touch of human interest to their
collecting, a charm on account of its quaintness.
Those who have sought these old cottage treasures
high and low and secured from far-away habitations
snug in the hills or lone huts on the wolds, or from the
dim-lit cabins of fisher folk these relics of byegone
days, read into their newly acquired possessions something
of the life history in their old environment,
lying <i>perdu</i> these many years, perched aloft on the
high mantel or hidden in the cupboard recess silently
listening to the old tales of the strange men and
women who live apart from the hum of cities.</p>

<p>Chelsea we know, Derby we know, Bow we know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
with their dainty china shepherdesses minding impossible
sheep, and with gallants prinked out in all the
colours of the humming-bird. These were the trifles
in porcelain that my dear Lady Disdain in a waft of
bergamot set apart in her glazed case by Sheraton.
In the days of paint and patch and of the revels at
Vauxhall and Ranelagh, virtuosos drowsily passed
comment on my lady's latest acquisition just to please
her passing whim and wean her from the vapours.</p>

<p>These earthenware figures "in homespun hose
and russet brown" suggest the old world nooks of
other days. Give Chelsea and Bow to the town.
This homely art of Staffordshire became English
after all. It was found in thatched cottages "with
breath of thyme and bees that hum." These boscage
shepherds and shepherdesses, these rustic musicians,
lusty post-boys, and the family of Toby Philpots, found
kinship in the miller and the farmer, the herdsman and
the milkmaid, the gamekeeper and the woodman, the
ostler and the waggoner&mdash;simple, kind-hearted folk,
the children of nature uncloyed by the subtleties
of art. Red-cheeked lasses and wrinkled crook-backed
old dames, mother and daughter and granddaughter,
toilers and sufferers, who chose the warm
west window seat in the sun and the ingle nook by
the fireside&mdash;these were the whilom owners of the old
Staffordshire figures. Somehow, nor is the fancy a
foolish one, one likes to associate these diminutive
figures with the old gardens of England set in sweet
places where one</p>

<p>There seems to be something added to old Staffordshire
figures which have steeped themselves in somnolent
repose these many years till they have become
invested with a subtle human interest not easily disassociated
from them.</p>

<p>The squire had his services of Worcester and of
Crown-Derby, and the nobleman relegated his cases
of fine porcelain to the care of his housekeeper, to
dust and to safeguard till he came again to hunt and
to shoot. But the cottager's Staffordshire figures
were lovingly handled when the good wife furbished
up her brass candlesticks, and they insensibly became
part of the environment of the cottage home.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the key to the charm and magic
which goes to the collecting of old Staffordshire
figures, even of the decadent period. There is within
them and around them and about them something
redolent of a sturdy peasantry, something sad, something
tinged with autumn days and autumn mists
because they belong to days that have faded, and
almost to a race that is extinct.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the earthenware productions at
Swansea are of a high artistic order. For a century,
from 1768 to about 1870, the Cambrian Pottery at
Swansea manufactured ware bearing various marks
and comprising a wide range of examples. During
part of the time a rival factory at Glamorgan, which
existed from 1814, to 1839, produced "opaque china"
and cream ware in common with Swansea.</p>

<p>Practically the history of the Cambrian Pottery
dates from 1790, when George Haynes bought the
factory. Fine black basalt ware was produced.
There are two recumbent figures of <i>Antony</i> and
<i>Cleopatra</i>, the latter in the Victoria and Albert
Museum having the impressed mark <span class="smcap">Swansea</span>, and
the former in the possession of Mr. C. F. Cox, and
marked with the name of the modeller, "G. Bentley,
Swansea, 22 May, 1791." The length of these figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
is 12 inches. Two somewhat similar recumbent
figures of <i>Antony</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i> in colours have been
attributed to Lowestoft (see "Lowestoft China," by
W. W. R. Spelman, Jarrold &amp; Sons, Norwich, 1905).
But these more properly belong to the Staffordshire
school, and are probably by Neale and Palmer.</p>

<p>Under-glaze blue-printed ware, notably "willow
pattern" from Caughley, had been made at Swansea
probably before Haynes bought the factory, certainly
not later than 1790, when Leeds commenced
similar imitations of Turner's "willow patterns."
Salt-glazed ware, some marked "Cambrian Pottery,"
but mostly unmarked, was made and decorated in
enamel colours with figure subjects, landscapes, and
flowers.</p>

<p>The transfer-printed ware is of great variety and
is excellently finished, and compares very favourably
with the best of the Staffordshire cream ware similarly
decorated, or with the highest productions of Leeds
in the same manner. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_405">p. 405</a>) a group
of various types of transfer-printed ware in black and
brown, and blue under-glaze transfer-printing. As
will be noticed, the Oriental influence from Caughley
and the china factories was very strong, but in the
print of the ship there is something suggestive of
Liverpool.</p>

<p>A very fine transfer-printed plate in black is
illustrated (<a href="#Page_397">p. 397</a>), showing something higher in
engraving than Staffordshire had attempted. It
stands, leaving out the delicate black transfer-printing
done on the Worcester porcelain, as an exceptionally
artistic piece of work. The adjacent plate
in the illustration at once shows the source of its
inspiration. It follows one of Wedgwood's Queen's ware
patterns painted in green and violet of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
grape pattern, although it must be admitted that
the Swansea adaptation is richer than the somewhat
thinner design found on old Wedgwood plates.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features in the history
of the Swansea factory is the introduction by Haynes
of a ware termed "opaque china," which was in
reality a finer and whiter kind of cream ware, and
eminently suitable for the painted decorations by
W. W. Young, an artist from the Bristol factory, who
painted from about 1803 to 1806, flowers and butterflies
and shells with great fidelity. He was followed
by another artist Thomas Pardoe, from the Derby
factory, who brought more poetry into his floral
subjects. Another artist named Evans painted
flower-pieces with almost equal beauty. We illustrate
a fine Cambrian vase painted by Pardoe, and a
Swansea jug painted by Evans (<a href="#Page_401">p. 401</a>).</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a very high standard of
painting on the Swansea ware prevailed during the
best period, and the illustration of a set of three
Swansea-ware bulb pots (see <a href="#Page_397">p. 397</a>) shows that
landscape painters of no mean gifts were employed.
It is this picturesque quality of decoration (dependent
in a great measure on the fact that from 1814
to 1824 porcelain was made too), together with the
equally fine quality of the ware itself, that has
placed Swansea well to the front among the collectors
of artistic earthenware.</p>

<p>We have alluded to Haynes the proprietor who
first brought the factory into prominence. This
was in 1790. But in 1802 it passed into the hands
of Lewis Weston Dillwyn, and it was during this
period that W. W. Young did the work we have
alluded to. In 1817 the factory passed into the
hands of the Bevingtons, and in 1824 it again came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
into the possession of the Dillwyn family, who held
it till about 1850, when the firm was known as
Evans and Glasson, and later as D. J. Evans &amp; Co.
until its close in 1870. During this long period the
marks assumed various characters. We have at the
end of this chapter given most of the more important
to enable collectors to identify the period of
their Swansea ware&mdash;when marked.</p>

<p>Another ware greatly collected must be alluded
to, of which an illustration is given (<a href="#Page_405">p. 405</a>). This
Etruscan ware, following the early example set by
Wedgwood, was an attempt to copy some of the
Greek vases which were painted red on a black body.</p>

<p>In "Dillwyn's Etruscan Ware," made only for
three years from 1847 to 1850, the body was a
warm red, and the design was impressed thereon
either by means of black transfer-printing or outline,
and the background was then painted and the
classic figures heightened. This ware is not always
marked, but when the mark appears it is in a scroll,
as given in the list of marks (<a href="#Page_416">p. 416</a>).</p>

<p><b>Lowesby Pottery.</b>&mdash;There is very little to be said
about this pottery in Leicestershire, which was conducted
under the auspices of Sir Francis Fowke
about 1835. The mark is always puzzling to collectors
which is a <i>fleur-de-lis</i> with the name Lowesby,
both impressed. The ware usually made at this
small pottery was red terra cotta coated with a dull
black upon which were flowers and butterflies painted
in bright enamel colours. This decoration was done
elsewhere, probably in London.</p>

<p><b>Liverpool.</b>&mdash;We have already alluded to the Liverpool
delft, but the story of Liverpool as a potting
centre is not yet complete. There was, of course,
the enormous business in transfer-printing on Staffordshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
cream ware established by Sadler and
Green. But they made cream ware themselves as
well as decorated it for others. Cream ware was produced
at the factories of Chaffers, Barnes, Pennington,
and others. And at a date immediately prior
to the cream ware, Shaw, of Liverpool, had made
"Astbury" and "Whieldon" and salt-glaze wares.
So that here at once is a difficulty, and a very great
one, in identifying with exactitude the origin of
some of these wares. There is a great deal yet to
be discovered concerning the long line of Liverpool
factories, and if only as much special attention had
been given to this locality as has been given to the
much smaller factory of Lowestoft, original research
might disentangle many a ceramic puzzle.</p>

<p><b>W. Reid &amp; Co.</b>&mdash;These potters made artistic
earthenware from about 1754 to 1760, another firm
established by Richard Abbey about 1793 continued
till 1796 to make cream ware of a high order. This
pottery, bought by Messrs. Worthington, was named
Herculaneum Pottery.</p>

<p><b>The Herculaneum Pottery</b> (1796&ndash;1841).&mdash;At first,
when a band of Staffordshire potters came over to
the new works, stoneware and black and red unglazed
ware in the Wedgwood manner were made.
Later a considerable amount of cream ware of
pleasing character was turned out. The various
marks found on the ware of this factory are given
at the end of this chapter. Shortly after the end of
the eighteenth century porcelain was made here,
and some of the examples are of a very high quality
both in potting and in decoration. From 1836
to 1841 the proprietors were Messrs. Close, Mort
&amp; Co.</p>

<p>Until more facts come to light and trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
research is applied to all classes of Liverpool ware
nothing definitely can be stated. But it is certain
that some of the Liverpool ware is so fine in
character as even to confuse old collectors who
have never seen specimens before.</p>

<p>We illustrate a Liverpool plate (<a href="#Page_409">p. 409</a>) with the
usual Oriental design, and having no special feature
about it which many another factory could not have
produced. Its blue is fine and its potting is excellent,
but it is not exceptional. The illustration beside it
(<a href="#Page_409">p. 409</a>) is of an earthenware mug some 5 inches in
height which undoubtedly is a puzzle to experts.
The exquisitely-painted exotic birds in rich colouring
are not less perfect than those painted on
Worcester vases or on Chelsea dishes. Indeed, it
seems to show very strong traces of the style of
Worcester painting. One is inclined to attribute
it to Liverpool with the proviso that it must have
been painted by some artist who had been trained at
Worcester. It will thus be seen by this case that
in unmarked earthenware there are exceptional
difficulties in correctly placing examples where
so much cream ware was made not very dissimilar
in character, and where artists, as we have seen
at Swansea, came over from other factories, apparently
to the confoundment of the present-day
collector.</p>

<p><b>Bristol.</b>&mdash;Joseph Ring in 1786 commenced to
make a cream ware with the assistance of potters
he engaged from Shelton in Staffordshire. In colour
it was a warm cream due to the glaze and not to the
body of the ware itself. Connected with this factory
are some finely painted flower-pieces in enamel
colours by William Fifield (born in 1777, and died
in 1857), and his son, John Fifield. The factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
changed hands in 1825, and became Pountney and
Allies and Pountney &amp; Co. until 1872. Many of
Fifield's decorated pieces with floral works bear
the name and date of the person for whom they
were made. These are quite characteristic of the
pottery, and occur after 1820 and in the Pountney
and Allies period. There is a strong similarity in
these chains of flowers and garlands to the Oriental
ware, and its later French imitation which poses
as Lowestoft. Much of this Bristol earthenware is
confounded with somewhat similar New Hall porcelain,
and is termed by very inexperienced buyers
and sellers as "cottage Worcester." "Cottage"
it may be, but it has no relationship with
Worcester.</p>

<p><b>Caughley or Salopian.</b>&mdash;The Caughley under-glaze
blue-printed ware with its rich almost purplish
blue is well known, but the various tints of this
blue employed in the porcelain are not so well
known varying as they do from this deep blue to
a fairly light slate blue&mdash;but that concerns china and
is another story. The Coalport factory china mark
at the present day has the date 1750, proudly
going back to these early days. Of Salopian
earthenware not too much is known, it is eclipsed
by the porcelain which Thomas Turner commenced
to make at Caughley in 1772.</p>

<p>But earthenware was made at the factory from
1750 to 1775 by Browne, the owner of the factory,
whose niece Thomas Turner married and took over
the pottery in 1772. There are, belonging to this
early period, some exceedingly well-modelled
Caughley figures which are equal to the finest work
of the Staffordshire potters. Some of these figures
are 20 inches in height, and among those attributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
to this Salopian pottery are the following: <i>Prudence</i>,
holding a mirror, draped classical figure with
figured gown; and <i>Fortitude</i>, a companion figure.
<i>Antony</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i> are also believed to belong
to this factory by some collectors. Caughley
pottery is sometimes, though rarely, marked with
the word <span class="smcap">Salopian</span> or with the initials S or C in
blue under the glaze. A considerable doubt still
exists as to what is and what is not Salopian or
Caughley earthenware, and an opinion should not be
hastily arrived at on superficial examination. Many
of the early under-glaze blue-printed porcelain cups
and saucers with Oriental designs similar in character
to the "willow pattern" bear a mark of a blue
crescent not unlike that of the Worcester factory.
When such specimens in earthenware are found
thus marked in under-glaze blue with the crescent
they may certainly be pronounced to be Caughley,
in date about 1772 to 1785. Some of the octagonal
dark blue-printed Caughley earthenware plates are of
similar shape to the Oriental porcelain model (illustrated
<a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>), and the design especially in the treatment
of the border is handled in the same manner
except that Turner was fonder of more crowded
detail.</p>

<p><b>Derby Earthenware.</b>&mdash;Derby porcelain is well
known. But it is not so well known that Derby
earthenware is worth considering from a collecting
point of view. There is a certain amount of
obscurity surrounding the early ware made at
Cockpit Hill. Slip ware was made in early days
and delft appears to have been made there at
the beginning of the eighteenth century. In 1772
the Derby pot-works, in the hands of the Heath
family who were bankers, produced cream ware,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
though not equal to the Staffordshire products.
Messrs. John and Christopher Heath, of Derby,
are described as "bankrupts" in 1780, and a great
sale of the earthenware in stock took place. The
collector has mainly to rely on dated examples,
which are very rare, or on pieces bearing local
allusions to elections which may be safely attributed
to Derby, but like so many of the extinct factories
the ware has not received special attention in regard
to its identification, nor is the task an easy one
owing to cream ware being of very general
manufacture.</p>

<p><b>Isleworth.</b>&mdash;There is not much known about this
factory established by Joseph Shore, who appears
to have come from Worcester in 1760. The ware
later is marked with the initials S. &amp; G. after the
firm became Shore and Goulding. The factory
was never very large, and employed only twenty
hands at the most. We illustrate (<a href="#Page_409">p. 409</a>) a copy
of the celebrated Portland Vase in red ware marked
S. &amp; G., and although some of the Isleworth ware
appears to have been coarse earthenware to which
the term "Welsh ware" was applied, some of it
reverting to the old method of slip decoration,
yet it must be admitted that certain pieces in red
unglazed earthenware are of a high artistic
character. There is a very fine teapot of this red
ware in exact imitation of the Oriental style, being
hexagonal in form, and having embossed decorations
on the panels, the lid being surmounted with
a Chinese grotesque animal, such as never was
designed in Europe. The potting of such pieces
as these has directed the attention of connoisseurs
to this obscure factory.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that some of the finer pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of Isleworth red ware have passed as Elers ware,
but the former has a slight glaze and the handles are
moulded. It is heavier in weight, and the teapots,
&amp;c., by Elers were undoubtedly of small dimensions.</p>

<p>It appears that "hound jugs" were made at Isleworth
too. They were made at Brampton and elsewhere,
but in those illustrated (<a href="#Page_413">p. 413</a>) the mark is S. &amp; G.
They are brown stoneware with subjects of game in
high relief, and are early nineteenth century in date.</p>

<p>In the second illustration it will be seen that
the handle of the hound jug shows a later stage
in its development. The reason is not far to seek,
the awkward points of the hound handle were
found to be in the way when Betsy Prue drew the
beer. Any projection of this nature is distinctly
out of place in earthenware for everyday use. This
the potter readily recognised, and pattern number
two was the result. Here he followed, without
knowing it, the practice of the Japanese, who in their
finely-carved ivory netsukes, so much collected nowadays,
which were used as buttons and fastenings for
dresses, always took care to leave no projecting
points&mdash;the sleeping mouse has his tail well coiled
around him&mdash;the dwarf mime has a smooth head and
a figure as rotund as a miniature barrel.</p>

<p>It will be seen in this second illustration that
the hound is still discernible in the handle, but
probably only to those who have seen him in his
former state. He has now become a clumsy,
twisted handle with less meaning. It is here that
his delicately balanced proportions when he was
leaping over the brim with outstretched limbs&mdash;the
attitude to the life of a hound when attempting
to get through a fence&mdash;became a mere symbol in
this later stage of his ceramic existence.</p>

<p>The pictorial history of the evolution is not a
pretty one. It shows how the rushing need of
the public for "more pots" destroyed the craft
of the potter. It was far easier, since the demand
was for pots, to turn out hasty work, and to let the
modelling take care of itself. For this reason the
mug degenerated into a mere commonplace mug,
such as Staffordshire could produce quite as cheaply
by the ton. So the factory put out its furnaces
for ever.</p>

<p>The collection of lustre ware is comparatively
modern. In common with salt-glaze ware which was
not thought much of in the auction-room some few
years ago, lustre-ware has been studied and collected
with avidity, and a good deal has been discovered
concerning its origin.</p>

<p>It may be said at the outset that lustre varies very
considerably in quality, and the plain undecorated
platinum or "silver" lustre is being produced at the
present day in teapots and cream-jugs in simulation
of the old Georgian silver patterns.</p>

<p>So great is its variety and quality that some collectors
have confined themselves specially to the
collection of what is known as silver lustre "resist"
style, and others have specialised in the pink or gold
purple, with veined effects, of the Wedgwood school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>Lustre ware may be divided into the following
classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Early brown copper lustre</i>, crude in style, made
by Frank, of Brislington, near Bristol, about 1770.</p>

<p>2. <i>Gold lustre</i>, probably invented by Josiah Wedgwood,
about 1792 (not to be confounded with gilding).
The effect varies from pink to purple, and in the
early pieces a combination was effected of gold,
yellow, and purple, iridescent in varying lights.</p>

<p>3. <i>Platinum or "silver" lustre</i> (discovered by
Thomas Wedgwood, the youngest son of Josiah
Wedgwood, about 1791), imitations of silver ware,
busts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. <i>Copper or bronze lustre</i> (differing from the coarse
early ware of Brislington), plain or undecorated.</p>

<p>5. Gold or purple lustre <i>used as an adjunct or
decoration</i>, either around band or rim, as at Sunderland,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>6. Platinum or "silver" lustre <i>used as an adjunct
or slight decoration</i> such as in the <i>Falstaff</i> figure
(illustrated <a href="#Page_371">p. 371</a>), or in the figure of <i>Cupid</i> (illustrated
<a href="#Page_387">p. 387</a>).</p>

<p>7. Platinum or "silver" lustre <i>in combination with
other painted decoration</i>: (<i>a</i>) Birds, foliage, &amp;c.,
painted in silver lustre on a ground of another colour;
(<i>b</i>) Silver lustre "resist" style when the ground is
platinum and the ornamentation is white, blue, or
yellow.</p>

<p>8. Copper or bronze lustre <i>in combination with
painted designs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Early Lustre (Brislington).</b>&mdash;Richard Frank, the delft
potter, of Bristol, produced a crude ware composed of
a hard body coated with a yellow dip resembling delft
in character, and, upon this surface, ornamentation in
copper lustre was made which gave it the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
of burnished copper. It has been most inaptly compared
with the Hispano-Mauro ware, with its rich
arabesque ornamentation. There is nothing in
common between the two except that they are both
lustrous, and here the similarity ends. The Brislington
colour was crude and the lustre ornaments
extremely inartistic, and only suitable for the baking-dishes
and mere utilitarian articles rudely and
sufficiently decorated. Finer and thinner lustre ware
found in the vicinity of Bristol can more safely be
attributed to Swansea.</p>

<p><b>Gold Lustre.</b>&mdash;As may readily be imagined, the
amount of gold in the lustre decoration is very small.
Gold lustre is <i>not</i> heavy English gilding. As early
as 1776 Josiah Wedgwood obtained a formula from
Dr. Fothergill, a Fellow of the Royal Society, of
which he himself was a Fellow, which induced him to
experiment with gold in order to produce lustrous
effects. The Purple of Cassius was employed with
great success in obtaining marbling and veining, but
it was not till late in his career, about 1792, that he
produced the gold lustre in its happiest combination
in connection with the fine Pearl Ware shell dessert-services.
We have already alluded to the thin wash
of yellow and pink which was applied to these dishes
to represent the interior of the shell, but the addition
of gold lustre was the finishing touch, and such pieces
are remarkably rare. They glow with fleeting colours
as the light plays upon their surface.</p>

<p>In regard to this gold lustre, it should be stated
that it varied, and varied most considerably, according
to the character of the body not only subjacent
to it, that is upon which it was placed, but owing to
its filmy and translucent character it received reflection
from adjacent surfaces. On a brown body the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
same effect is different from that on a white or cream
body. This must be borne in mind to a smaller
extent in platinum lustres. The warmer the body
beneath, the richer the lustre and the greater its
similarity to the silver which it is intended to imitate.</p>

<p>We illustrate two very fine mottled pink and gold
lustre goblets which belong to the Wedgwood period
and are very light and of very fine lustrous appearance
(<a href="#Page_425">p. 425</a>). In certain districts these are termed
"Funeral cups," and whether they were used only on
those solemn occasions or not, we cannot say.</p>

<p>It appears that gold lustre was sometimes used in
combination with copper or bronze. In the two
mugs illustrated (<a href="#Page_425">p. 425</a>), the interiors are finely
mottled in purple and gold, and suggest by the
beautiful potting the work of the goldsmith in their
sharp contour. They may be attributed to the best
period, as, too, may the goblet in the centre which
glows like gold. Incidentally it may be remarked
that the photographs used for these illustrations
cannot convey the rich and glorious colouring of
these examples.</p>

<p>The writer knows of a cup and saucer marked
"Dawson." There was a Samuel Dawson in 1802,
a Staffordshire potter, and there is Dawson of
Sunderland, a better-known maker of ware, which
has lustre decoration, to which latter pottery this
may more safely be attributed. In general effect the
scheme of colour is ambitious. The centre panel is
painted in red enamel colours over the glaze. The
borders have a highly lustrous gold floral decoration
on a ground of pink.</p>

<p>In regard to Sunderland and Newcastle, as a rule,
the ware is crude and may be readily dismissed, but
not too hurriedly. The rough bands of purple lustre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
inartistically painted as borders to the transfer-printed
jugs and mugs with nautical subjects are
well known. In broad effect on a jug or a punch
bowl, this class of pink or purple lustre decoration is
seen at its best. On a jug of this nature with bands
and rough spongings of purple lustre appear the
verses&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">"The man doomed to sail</div>
<div class="i2">With the blast of the gale,</div>
<div class="i0">Through billows Atlantic to steer,</div>
<div class="i2">As he bends o'er the wave</div>
<div class="i2">Which may soon be his grave</div>
<div class="i0">Remembers his home with a tear."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is not a happy sentiment and suggests more the
landsman's views of the sea than those of the sailor.
The following has a truer ring, but it was not put on
jugs to be sold to sailors' wives:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Go patter to lubbers and swabs, d'ye see,</div>
<div class="i2">'Bout danger and fear and the like;</div>
<div class="i0">A tight water-boat and good sea room give me,</div>
<div class="i2">And it ain't to a little I'll strike."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b>Platinum or Silver Lustre.</b>&mdash;It is not definitely
known who was the first potter to adopt this decoration.
Obviously it could not be earlier in date than
the year that platinum was discovered as a new metal.
Its chemical individuality and qualities were established
by the successive researches of Scheffer (1752),
Marggraft (1757), Bergmann (1777). In 1784 the first
platinum crucible was made by Achard. In 1800
Knight, of London, published all that was known
concerning the use of platinum in manufacture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Thomas Wedgwood, the youngest son of Josiah,
employed it as early as 1791, but it is claimed that
John Hancock (born 1757, died 1847), first employed
gold, silver, and steel lustres at Messrs. Spode's
factory at Stoke for Messrs. Daniel and Brown, who
were decorating Spode ware at that date. That is
his own account when he was eighty-nine years of
age. But he was employed at Etruria. At any rate
Hancock did not retain the secret, for among contemporary
potters John Gardner, of Stoke, Sparkes,
of Hanley, and Horobin, of Tunstall, seem to have
practised it. At the beginning of the nineteenth
century other potters were making lustre. In 1804
John Aynsley, of Lane End, and in 1810 Peter Warburton,
of Lane End, who took out a patent for
"decorating china, porcelain, earthenware, and glass
with native pure or unadulterated gold, silver, platina,
or other metals fluxed or lowered with lead or any
other substance which invention or new method
leaves the metals, after being burned, in their metallic
state."</p>

<p>Pieces of silver lustre occur with the name Wood
and Caldwell impressed on them. This was the style
of the firm from 1790 to 1818. Such pieces may
have been made during the last years of the factory's
existence. But we know that it was made in 1810,
for a painted lustre jug bears the inscription
"Richard Bacchus, 1810." Another name which the
writer has seen impressed on plain silver lustre ware
of Early-Georgian shape is E. Mayer, who commenced
as a potter in 1770, and died in 1818. It
thus appears that at present, until more marked pieces
turn up, the exact date within a few years of the
manufacture of platinum or silver lustre in its first
form is not determinable.</p>

<p>Among makers known to have produced silver
lustre are Robert Wilson, of Hanley, who was in
partnership with Neale prior to the manufacture of
this ware. His brother David Wilson, in the opening
years of the nineteenth century, made silver lustre
goblets and figures. There is a mounted figure of a
hussar with uplifted sword attributed to the Wilsons,
at the British Museum. The Wilsons also made
copper or bronze lustre ware. Lakin and Poole is
the name of another firm, and Spode, and it is
believed Davenport embarked on this popular ware
also. It is known, too, that Leeds made silver lustre
ware of fine quality, that has stood the test of time;
and gold lustre in imitation of Wedgwood's "Pearl
Ware" lustrous decorations was made in early nineteenth-century
days. Swansea is credited with similar
productions of gold and gold-purple lustre on a
marbled ground, although none of its silver-lustre
ware is marked.</p>

<p>Probably the earliest use of silver lustre was when
it was employed as an adjunct to figures in subsidiary
portions in lieu of gilding. But most certainly it
began to simulate the silver ware at an early date.
This early type is undecorated, and was also used in
busts or statuettes of classical form. We illustrate a
pair of silver-lustre figures by Wood and Caldwell.
There is another pair of children in silver lustre,
marked Wood &amp; Caldwell, which are colourable
imitation of the figures of "children reading" made
by Dwight (illustrated, <a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>).</p>

<p>In regard to decorated silver lustre we give two
examples which are fairly typical of a large class.
The illustration (<a href="#Page_431">p. 431</a>) shows a jug decorated in
enamel colours. The bird is in red and the foliage
in green, on a cream ground. The border of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
panel is in silver lustre and the rim of the jug and
the bands around neck are also silver lustre.</p>

<p>This decorated silver-lustre ware is of two classes.
The first class comprises patterns painted in silver
lustre on a white ground, the foliage and birds and
other patterns being in silver lustre, carefully painted
over the white. As a rule in such pieces there is
more white showing, and the lustre silver is palpably
a decorative effect.</p>

<p>In the second class the silver lustre appears as a
background, and the ornamental decoration is in
white, covering the piece in most elaborate designs.
This is known as "resist" ware, and on account of
the great beauty and variety of its ornamentation,
has strongly appealed to latter-day collectors.
The pattern twining its way over the silver-lustre
background may be white, blue, canary colour, pink,
apricot, or turquoise-blue. White is most frequently
found.</p>

<p>This second style is capable of the most intricate
designs varying from farmyard and hunting scenes
to ordinary conventional floral arrangements almost
resembling the Japanese stencilled work in another
field of art.</p>

<p><b>How "resist" ware is made.</b>&mdash;If a white design is intended
the ware is left white, but if any other colour,
such as those we have mentioned, that colour is laid
as a body or ground colour on the specimen to be
lustred. The next step is to paint the exact design
which later is to appear white, or blue, or yellow, on
the surface of the vessel. This pattern is painted or
stencilled on the ware with a substance composed of
a glucose matter such as glycerine. The next stage
is to apply the silver lustre to the whole surface
which is allowed partially to dry. On its immersion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
in water the pattern painted previously to the
addition of lustre peels off being on a soluble ground.
The result is that the background of white or yellow
or blue is laid bare, and the rest of the vessel is
covered permanently with silver lustre. The adhesive
lustre "resists" the water, adhering to the surface
by means of its resinous nature, except in the
pattern which peels off. Hence the term "resist"
ware.</p>

<p>We illustrate one specimen of this silver-lustre
"resist" ware (<a href="#Page_431">p. 431</a>). It is of the ordinary floral
conventional pattern probably stencilled on as
described above. Some of the more elaborate
specimens are painted. One of the finest collections
of "Resist Silver Lustre" is that of Mr. William
Ward, at the Kennels, Mellor, near Blackburn. It
comprises examples that one may search for in vain
in any of the museums. Many of the examples are
marked such as "Warburton," or with the letter
"W" impressed, and one specimen is marked
"Leeds" a rare mark. The subjects of some of
these jugs and mugs relate to the Napoleonic wars,
and are dated. There is one rare jug entitled
"Boney escaping through a Window," and in combination
with this "resist" style are examples finely
painted or transfer-printed in colours.</p>

<p><b>Copper or Bronze Lustre.</b>&mdash;This class of lustre is
generally held to be later (excepting of course the
early attempts at Brislington which stand by themselves).
It is held too by collectors up to the present
not to offer such artistic possibilities as the "resist"
silver lustre. This is amply borne out by the prices
obtained at auction. But it must not be forgotten
that this bronze or copper lustre varies very considerably.
It may be and often is very coarse brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
ordinary ware, and it may be very thin and delicate
as to tempt the connoisseur to regard it with more
than a passing glance.</p>

<p>In the highest forms of copper or bronze lustre,
painted views appear in panels against the lustrous
background, and such views are of a high order of
merit. They may in all probability have been
executed at Swansea. We illustrate a fine example
(<a href="#Page_437">p. 437</a>) of a large copper lustre mug with painted
panel of landscape and other panels of fruit.</p>

<p>Very frequently in this copper lustre the jugs and
mugs have ornamentation in relief which is enamelled
in vivid colours. This is a fairly common form, and
has been reproduced in very coarse examples, not to
be confounded with the finer and thinner copper
lustre at its best. We illustrate a copper lustre jug
(<a href="#Page_437">p. 437</a>) with serpent handle and Bellarmine mask
spout, decorated in turquoise blue, and with basket
of flowers in relief. The Goblet to the right is of
similar decoration, and that on the left is of conventional
coloured design on a mottled pink lustred
band.</p>

<p><b>Marked Lustre Ware.</b>&mdash;We have already mentioned
a number of potters who are known to have made
lustre ware, but the following names have been found
impressed on the ware in various collections throughout
the country, and may be of interest to collectors
who have specimens either by these potters or by
other makers not on this list. Wedgwood, Wilson,
Warburton, Bailey and Batkin, J. Lockett &amp; Sons,
E. Mayer, Mayer &amp; Newbold, E. Wood, Wood &amp;
Caldwell, Minton, Bott &amp; Co., P. &amp; U. (Poole &amp;

China&mdash;The Masons&mdash;Early

<p>The latest phases of earthenware are mainly concerned
with the school of colourists, the chief of which
was Josiah Spode the Second, who controlled the factory
on the death of Josiah his father, in 1797, and
took William Copeland as partner. It was this Spode
who introduced into earthenware decorative patterns
of Japanese colouring in which reds and yellows and
dark cobalt blue predominate, following the style of
the Crown-Derby Japan style. About 1800 Spode
commenced the manufacture of porcelain as well as
earthenware, and his richly gilded Japan patterns
began to rival those of Derby. In regard to the
light-blue-printed ware of a fine quality turned out
by Spode, an illustration is given in the chapter on
Transfer-printed Ware (<a href="#Page_331">p. 331</a>). It was this second
Josiah Spode who standardised the body used in
English porcelain, which is to-day practically the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
same as Spode's formula. It may be said, roughly,
to consist of the constituents of true porcelain plus a
proportion of bone ash. Enoch Wood, when an
apprentice with Palmer, was the first to use bone
with earthenware, about 1770.</p>

<p>It is obvious that with these rich colours of Staffordshire
porcelain side by side in the same factory,
with earthenware, the latter began to assume all
the decorative appearance of porcelain. A reign
of colour set in. Earthenware was as lavishly
decorated in colours, and as richly gilded as any
of the contemporary porcelains, and in putting on
these colours it lost all its old characteristic features
and became an echo of porcelain.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Spode family, it may be mentioned
that Josiah Spode the second, who died in
1827, aged seventy-three, was succeeded by his son,
Josiah Spode the third, who died within two years.</p>

<p>William Copeland had died in 1826, and in 1833
the factory at Stoke came into the hands of W. T.
Copeland, known as Alderman Copeland, as he then
was, of the City of London. He became Lord Mayor
of London in 1835, and in that year took Thomas
Garrett into partnership. Copeland and Garrett is
the name of the firm till 1847. For twenty years
it was known as "W. T. Copeland, late Spode,"
and is now at the present day Messrs. W. T. Copeland
&amp; Sons.</p>

<p>The marks belonging to the firm at various dates
are given at the end of this chapter. We illustrate
a row of five remarkably fine earthenware vases
decorated in rich colour in the Derby style, so perfectly
simulating the brush work of that famous
porcelain factory, that upon a hasty examination
they would pass for Crown-Derby. They evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
belong to the days when Josiah Spode was turning
out at Stoke more Japan patterns than were produced
at Derby.</p>

<p>At the same time a good deal of less ornate
earthenware for cottage use was being made, and
specimens may frequently be met with, such as tea-sets
with old-fashioned teapot and two-handled
sugar-bowl made about 1825. Their homely English
rural subjects are very pleasing, and show that there
was still a large market in the country for simple
ware without any great pretensions to foreign taste.
It was the last stage of the great tradition of old
English earthenware.</p>

<p><b>Davenport (1793&ndash;1880).</b>&mdash;John Davenport, of Longport
in Staffordshire, began potting in 1793. There
is no doubt that he was a great potter with artistic
instincts. He went to France prior to 1800, and on
his return introduced a porcelain body superior to
anything then produced in England. With Josiah
Spode the second he claims more attention as a
maker of porcelain than of earthenware. But his
earthenware is highly prized by collectors. His
blue-printed ware was exceptionally fine, and he
followed in his plates and dishes the style of Turner
and of Minton in the perforated rims. His stone
china is well potted and carefully painted, and in
design he was not loth to follow Mason of whom we
shall speak later. Many specimens of the familiar
type of jug associated with Mason's name, of octagonal
shape are found in porcelain. Some collectors
noticing the great similarity to Mason have been
inclined to attribute these porcelain jugs to him, and
doubtless, as Mason made china, many are his, but
Davenport who made replicas of the Mason stoneware
jugs, being a maker of porcelain too, is likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
to have produced these porcelain replicas also. None
of these porcelain jugs appears to be marked.</p>

<p>Davenport ware is strong in colour, and follows
the rich designs of Spode. Some pieces of stoneware
are richly gilt, and have finely painted fruit-pieces
and landscapes, some probably by Steel from the
Derby factory. The illustration (<a href="#Page_447">p. 447</a>) of the
highest flight of Mason typifies this class of landscape
ware. Swansea, in common with Staffordshire,
had not hesitated in painting earthenware with landscape
subjects hitherto employed only by artists who
decorated porcelain.</p>

<p>The Davenport marks are given at the end of this
chapter, and are always prized when found on
specimens, as Davenport did not mark his ware so
freely as did Spode. From 1835 the firm became
"William Davenport &amp; Co.," and later "Davenport
&amp; Co.," and ceased about 1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Semi-porcelain.</b>&mdash;This is found as a term in some of
the marks of the early-Victorian period; sometimes
the title "opaque china" appears. These descriptions
are always puzzling to the collector. As a matter of
fact they tell of the later and more modern development
of earthenware. It had snatched the china
glaze, it had employed the enamel colours, and had
adopted the designs of the English porcelain
factories. The rivalry of the Staffordshire potters
and the English porcelain factories was coming to an
end. This stage of semi-porcelain and semi-china
represented the last word of earthenware. It now
simulated porcelain in its body, with one drawback,
it was not translucent as is porcelain. It was na&iuml;vely
termed "opaque china." But the potters were proud
of their latest achievement, and accordingly marked
their wares with the above terms. As has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
shown, Swansea came to the front, and Haynes in
the closing years of the eighteenth century produced
a hard, white earthenware termed "opaque-china,"
and Riley's "semi-china" about 1800 was the
Staffordshire equivalent.</p>

<p>But, as we have seen, the Staffordshire potters not
only imitated porcelain, continuing a long trade
rivalry extending over nearly a century, but many of
them had commenced to make porcelain themselves.
Even the firm of Wedgwood succumbed to the
temptation, and made porcelain from 1805 till 1815,
which manufacture was revived again in 1878.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Minton (1765&ndash;1836).</b>&mdash;Minton was one of
Spode's engravers, and commenced as a master potter
at Stoke in 1793.</p>

<p>Minton had been apprenticed to Thomas Turner,
of Caughley, as an engraver, and it was he who
designed the celebrated "Broseley dragon" pattern
on the Caughley porcelain, and it is held by some
authorities that Minton engraved the "willow
pattern" too. At first, at Stoke, he made only
earthenware, and his blue and white ware in imitation
of the Nankin porcelain won him distinction. About
1800 porcelain was made and was continued throughout
the nineteenth century. His son, Herbert
Minton in 1836, took into partnership John Boyle,
who joined the Wedgwoods in 1842. Herbert
Minton raised the quality of the productions, being
one of the greatest of the Staffordshire modern
potters.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the century Mintons obtained
a world-wide reputation. From 1850 to 1870 a
band of French modellers and painters executed
some fine work, but this trespasses on the field of
porcelain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the earthenware of Minton some of the
early pieces such as plates and dishes enamelled in
colours with Chinese subjects, are marked with the
letter M in blue and a number. Some of the earliest-known
examples in earthenware of the celebrated
"willow pattern," such as plates with perforated
edges (similar to that illustrated, <a href="#Page_331">p. 331</a>) and baskets,
are by Thomas Minton.</p>

<p><b>Ironstone China.</b>&mdash;This again is a term used by
Mason and others in regard to an earthenware body
for which the firm of Mason, of Lane Delph, took
out a patent in 1813. It is a ware, heavy in weight,
and possessing great strength. In pieces of important
size, such as punch bowls of huge proportions,
and posts for old-fashioned bedsteads this was of no
little value. We have already alluded to the Mason
series of octagonal-shaped jugs of pleasing shape,
undoubtedly following the Spode scheme of colour
in Japanese style, but lacking the finer finish of Spode
ware. Although undoubtedly original in design,
these jugs were easily excelled in potting and colouring
by copyists such as Davenport. But Mason's
blue in his imitations of old Nankin ware is exceptionally
fine. There are dinner-services consisting of
a great number of pieces painted in under-glaze blue
which are very rich in tone, and stand comparison
with any of the blues of Staffordshire, not excepting
those of Adams and Minton.</p>

<p>We illustrate a large vase obviously a replica of a
Chinese model, and enamelled in very rich colours.
It shows a remarkable facility in potting, and
although strongly coloured conveys without caricature
the decorative qualities of the Chinese potter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a></span></p>

<p>The vase is two feet in height. The ground is
grass green. The panels have painted landscapes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
Imari colours. The base and the top are a rich blue
heavily gilded, and the dragon handles are a salmon
pink. Obviously this, although imitative, is a very
ambitious piece.</p>

<p>The mark of this vase stamped on the bottom
(illustrated <a href="#Page_451">p. 451</a>) is interesting. An outline design
represents the pottery works. It is marked "Fenton
Stone Works C. J. M. &amp; Co." and in the outer rim is
the inscription "Granite china," "Staffordshire
Potteries."</p>

<p>The initials C. J. M. stand for Charles James
Mason, who together with G. Miles Mason applied
for the ironstone china patent in 1813.</p>

<p>Among other ware, similar to the early cream ware
is a body termed "Mason's Cambrian-Argil." This
evidently is in direct rivalry to the Swansea cream
ware marked "Cambrian." Earlier jugs by him are
rarely marked, and are not of the octagonal form,
though the sides are prismatic, and usually seven in
number. They are of a buff-coloured, soft, and chalky
body, but the decorations are obviously his in similar
style to his series of stoneware jugs. The handle of
this earlier form is not of the snake or lizard form,
but follows in design the metal handle of teapots
of the period.</p>

<p>That the Masons could and did produce earthenware
of a very high, artistic quality is shown by the
illustration (<a href="#Page_447">p. 447</a>) of three pieces marked with the
impressed mark running in one line across the back
of the examples "<span class="smcap">Mason's Patent Ironstone
China</span>." The gilding in the floral design in the
borders is well done, and the landscapes in the
centre are finely painted. They are in the brush work
patiently stippled with as much minuteness as
the work of Birket Foster. A dessert service of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
this forms portion, is a very desirable acquisition,
and represents stone china at its high-water mark.</p>

<p>The various marks used by the Masons are given
at the end of this chapter. In 1851 the pottery was
purchased by Francis Morley, and it was incorporated
with Ridgway, Morley, Wear &amp; Co., and at a
later date passed into the hands of Messrs. C. E.
Ashworth and Taylor Ashworth, who to this day
revert to the original patterns of the Mason jugs
which have become so deservedly popular. Most of
these old patterns are being produced, although of
course they have not the charm for the collector whose
interest ends with the original period under Mason.</p>

<p>"Stone china" became a term used by many other
potters who produced strong and durable earthenware,
heavy in weight, and extremely suitable for domestic
use. Mintons had a series of patterns in this ware
decorated in Oriental style in colour. The most
popular of these is one termed "Amherst, Japan,"
following the old anglicised versions of Japanese
Imari designs and colours. This was at the date
when Lord Amherst was in the public eyes. It will
be remembered that he headed an embassy to China,
and was requested to perform the <i>ko-tou</i>, or act of
prostration, nine times repeated with the head touching
the ground. Sir George Staunton and other
members of the Canton Mission protested, and the
mission was admitted to the Emperor's presence on
their own terms, which consisted of kneeling upon a
single knee. Lord Amherst was later appointed
Governor-General of India. There are a great many
potters whose names are found on earthenware of
mid-Victorian days. They cannot be said to
exhibit much originality in design, and their value
as collectors' specimens is infinitesimal.</p>

<p>We illustrate two finely-potted stoneware plates,
by Messrs. C. Meigh and Sons, made about 1850.
They are printed in blue with designs of English
primroses twined with peacock feathers! Here is
East and West in strange combination. Fortunately
the plates are not in colours or the result might have
been disastrous; as it is they are very pleasing for the
blue is of a very excellent tone. There is nothing
hasty about the potting; the finish and the minor
details suggest work of the old days long gone. It
is evident that in the treatment of the design the
inspiration came from the Japanese potter whose
influence was beginning to make itself felt in pictorial
art even so far back as the middle of the nineteenth
century. Whistler's peacocks and the dawn of the
later &aelig;stheticism were at hand.</p>

<p><b>Nineteenth Century Commemorative Ware.</b>&mdash;It has
been previously shown how fond the potters became
of recording events and creating figures of popular
heroes in earthenware. The story is continued in
the nineteenth century, which covers, one is apt to
forget, the last twenty years of the reign of
George III., includes the ten years of George the
Fourth's reign, and the seven of William IV., commencing
the Victorian Era in 1837 on the accession
of the late Queen.</p>

<p>So that the term early nineteenth century is not the
same as early Victorian; as a matter of fact a good
deal of very good porcelain and earthenware comes
well within the nineteenth century, but very few
examples that appeal to the artistic collector belong
to the early-Victorian period.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century as a whole was crowded
with incident, and in the class of earthenware with
which we are now dealing the record is a full one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
From Nelson to Garibaldi; from Maria Martin the
victim of the Red Barn murder to Moody and Sankey,
the American revivalists; from Napoleon crossing
the Alps to George III., as the King of Brobdingnag,
looking at Napoleon through a telescope; from
Burns's <i>Souter Johnny</i> to Dickens's <i>Sam Weller</i>;
from punch bowls, inscribed "Rum and Water"
and "Health to all," to figures of Father Mathew,
the temperance reformer&mdash;all sub-heads are touched,
and although the artistic may be absent the human
touch is ever present.</p>

<p>There are jugs and mugs with a portrait
of "Orator Hunt," with inscriptions "Universal
Suffrage," "No Corn Laws," dating from 1818.
A lustre mug has a print with a dragoon represented
as riding over a woman, and has the legend,
"Murdered on the plains of Peterloo, near Manchester,
16th August, 1819." The woman carries a
flag inscribed, "Liberty or Death."</p>

<p>A puzzle jug of Staffordshire earthenware is
inscribed, "Hatfield shot at George III., 1800. God
save the King." The trial of Queen Caroline produced
a crowd of figures and mugs and plates with
portraits and verses. The Crimean War had its
ceramic record. There is a Newcastle earthenware
butter-dish printed and coloured, with an English
soldier greeting a French soldier, and motto, "May
they ever be united."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a></span></p>

<p>The transfer-printed jugs and mugs with nautical
subjects we have already alluded to in a previous
chapter. The unfamiliar uniform of the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth century "Jack Tar"
is a study in costume. This silent ceramic world
of old three deckers and ships of the line and
barques and brigantines is all that is left of a fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
of ships which have long since sailed their last
voyage&mdash;an armada of non-existent craft as ghostly
as the phantom ship of Vanderdecken.</p>

<p>Nelson jugs are of many types; we illustrate two
varieties (<a href="#Page_459">p. 459</a>). Some of them are as early as 1797,
and others as late as 1820.</p>

<p>The top jug illustrated is of Staffordshire cream
ware, and is in date after Trafalgar (1805), made
to commemorate this victory. The portrait of
Nelson has an inscription over it, "England Expects
every Man to do his Duty." On the reverse is a
plan of the Battle of Trafalgar with the disposition
of the ships and a slight description which ends in
the sentence "in which Action the Intrepid Nelson
fell covered with Glory and Renown."</p>

<p>The lower jug is of the same period and the
portrait of Nelson is more authentic. It is transfer-printed,
the uniform being slightly touched in colour.
On the reverse there is a female figure and two
children, and the sad human touch in the inscription,
"Behold the Widow casting herself and Orphans on
benevolent Britons." This is, indeed, the reverse of
the medal. The glory of war is exalted unduly.
But the awful reality does not always come home
so pointedly as in this homely jug, which in
its way records the "simple annals of the poor."
We are reminded of the lines of that forgotten
poet, Amelia Opie, and of the wood-engraving by
Dalziel in Willmott's "Poets of the Nineteenth
Century," published in the sixties. "The Orphan
Boy's Tale," who tells how pleased he was&mdash;</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly such human touches as these
on the domestic crude ware which stir the heart's
blood quicker than all the gods and goddesses ever
turned out in Staffordshire.</p>

<p>The age of steam and steel and its inventions
did not come unheralded. We illustrate a plate
of one of the earliest steam carriages (<a href="#Page_463">p. 463</a>). The
plate is of Staffordshire origin and evidently was
intended to be sold in Germany as a "present from
London," as the inscription runs, "Dampf Wagen
von London nach Bristol. Ein Geschenk f&uuml;r
meinen Lieben Jungen" ("Steam Coach from London
to Bristol. A Present for my dear boy"). In
date this is about 1827 as the accompanying engraving,
entitled the "New Steam Carriage," is from a
periodical publication of that date.</p>

<p>Equally interesting is the Staffordshire blue-printed
<i>Jug</i> marked at back "Liverpool and
Manchester Railway" showing the famous <i>Rocket</i>
steam-engine invented by George Stephenson. The
date of this is 1830. A fine <i>Cyder Mug</i> printed in
black with touches of colour shows an early passenger
train. The luggage, as will be seen, is on the
roofs of the carriages. The aristocratic company
at the rear are seated in their own carriage, the
ladies of the party are noticeable by their old-fashioned
poke bonnets. There is something very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
interesting in these old railway mugs and jugs.
They are modern, that is in regard to technique and
artistic beauty, but the subjects are of sufficient
interest to make the ware important enough to
find a treasured place of honour in the collector's
cabinet.</p>

<p><b>Lambeth Stoneware.</b>&mdash;Mention should be made
of the revival of artistic stoneware at Lambeth about
1850 by Henry Doulton, of the Lambeth pottery.
An attempt was made to make vessels for ordinary
use as ornamental in character as the old Flemish
stoneware. Some of the early pieces are in brown
stoneware with incised decoration filled with blue-glaze.
Tankards and vases and jugs were made
of very pleasing character. Under Sir Henry
Doulton great advances were made, and mugs with
hunting subjects and many grotesque brandy bottles
of stoneware were made. Light brown stoneware
flasks modelled to represent Lord Brougham, and
impressed "The True Spirit of Reform," and
"Brougham's Reform Cordial," are often of Lambeth
origin. In date these are about 1830, other factories
made similar ware, including the Derbyshire potteries.</p>

<p>Of the Doulton and Watts period which commenced
1815, from 1815 to 1832 some fine
Napoleonic stoneware was turned out. There is,
in particular, a small stoneware, brown jar of
Napoleon made about 1825, which is finely modelled
and an excellent portrait. In the Reform days of
the early thirties they produced, to supply a public
demand, many spirit jars with more or less grotesque
models of Earl Grey, Lord Brougham, William
Cobbett, and Lord John Russell. In the museum
at Messrs. Doulton's at Lambeth are some fine
examples of the early period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>We illustrate a strongly modelled jug with
Bacchanalian subject in high relief (<a href="#Page_471">p. 471</a>), showing
the excellence of some of this early work at its
best.</p>

<p><b>The Twentieth Century Collector.</b>&mdash;The story of the
triumphs and sometimes of the decadence of English
pottery cannot be ended without a passing reference
to the wondrous ware being produced at the end
of the nineteenth century and now. It should
appeal to-day to the prescient collector. It will
appeal to the collector fifty years hence.</p>

<p>Under the name of the Lancastrian Pottery
Messrs. Pilkington, at Clifton Junction, near Manchester,
have during the past few years produced
some of the most beautiful ware ever seen in this
country. At the exhibition of this ware in London
in 1904 they astonished all experts. The indescribable
variety of exquisite colours, ranging from faint
pink and sky blue to the richest purple and dark
green and amber, showed at once that modern
scientific methods and painstaking research had rediscovered
the lost glazes of the old Chinese potters.</p>

<p>The starry crystalline glazes so well known in
the Copenhagen porcelain have been faithfully
reproduced, recalling the patterns traced on the
window-pane by frost&mdash;sometimes brilliantly coloured
blue or green against a background of pale lavender
blue, at other times having a sheen like bronze.
Other crystalline glazes are the <i>Sunstone</i> in which
brilliant prismatic and golden crystals are disseminated
through rich green yellow or olive brown
glazes. The fiery crystalline glazes display brilliant
red crystalline formation through purple and grey
glaze in dazzling patches.</p>

<p>Opalescent clouded, or curdled, or veined, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
serpentine glazes have countless variations of colours&mdash;copper-green,
turquoise-blue, or deep lapis-lazuli
broken with white curds, or opalescent veinings,
or fine lines of variegated colour shot through the
glaze from top to bottom&mdash;this alone suggests a
dream of colour schemes, and the wise collector will
realise without further ado that we are in a period of
great ceramic triumphs in pottery of this nature.</p>

<p>Texture glazes of chicken-skin, fruit-skin, and
orange-skin are highly prized, and vellum or egg-shell
glazes splashed and marked like Nature's own
handiwork in the most beautiful birds' eggs. Or
there are metallic effects of peculiar beauty and
golden lacquer glazes resembling the old gold lac-work
of Chinese and Japanese artists so cunningly
imitated by Martin, the French cabinet-maker, in
his Vernis-Martin, so beloved of collectors of
furniture and fans.</p>

<p>Of purple glazes of the transmutation class some
of the richest effects have been obtained in colour
and in splashed effects. Wine purple, mulberry, and
other alluring tones have burst upon an astonished
circle of connoisseurs. Of the <i>flamb&eacute;</i> specimens
it is not too much to say that their like, for which
the Chinese potters were so famous, have never been
seen before in Europe.</p>

<p>The Havilands of Limoges, Copenhagen, and
S&egrave;vres, and Berlin potters, as well as the artists
in the Rookwood Pottery in America, have
worked in the same field; but it is pleasant to
think that English potters have produced greater
variety, including Lancastrian lustre ware of wealth
of glowing colour not surpassed by the Hispano-Moresque
potters nor by the lustrous majolica of the
Italian renaissance. To the scientific activity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
wresting from the past the lost secrets of the old
Chinese potters, a great tribute of praise should
be accorded to Mr. William Burton and his brother,
Mr. Joseph Burton.</p>

<p>Other workers in the same field of glazes are
Mr. Bernard Moore, of London, whose glorious
<i>flamb&eacute;</i>, rich red, and <i>sang-de-b&oelig;uf</i> glazes are of
unsurpassed beauty. Mr. William de Morgan has
for many years been known for his lustrous tiles
and work of fine originality and strength. Another
pottery known as the Ruskin Pottery conducted
by Mr. W. Howson Taylor at West Smethwick,
Birmingham, is a bright spot in recent ceramic
enterprise, and has won distinction for ware which is
of great beauty.</p>

<p>In bringing the story of English earthenware
to a conclusion, it is the hope of the writer that
the ground has been sufficiently covered to provide
an outline history of a complex subject. It may
be that much appears that might have been omitted,
and that much is omitted that might have appeared
within these covers. But it must be allowed that
personal tastes play an important part in selection
either by the collector or by the student. But in
matters of fact and in the mass of details relative
to the potters and their wares no pains have been
spared to make this little handbook worthy of its
subject.</p>

<p class="ph3">MARKS FOUND ON LATE STAFFORDSHIRE
EARTHENWARE.</p>


<p>The first half of the nineteenth century in earthenware
included a variety of types: (1) the last output
of the classical school; (2) cream ware transfer-printing
in under-glaze blue; (3) the school of
colourists in imitation of English porcelain.</p>

<p>In the following list a great many names appear
of potters not well known nor worthy of more than
passing allusion. But their trade marks often puzzle
collectors.</p>
